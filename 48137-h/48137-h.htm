<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, June 3, 1756.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="drcap">T</span>he particles of air are kept at a distance from each
other by their mutual repulsion.</p>

<p>Every three particles, mutually and equally repelling
each other, must form an equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>All the particles of air gravitate towards the earth,
which gravitation compresses them, and shortens the
sides of the triangles, otherwise their mutual repellency
would force them to greater distances from each
other.</p>

<p>Whatever particles of other matter (not endued with
that repellency) are supported in air, must adhere to
the particles of air, and be supported by them; for in
the vacancies there is nothing they can rest on.</p>

<p>Air and water mutually attract each other. Hence
water will dissolve in air, as salt in water.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of matter is not altered by di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>viding
the matter, though the superficies be increased.
Sixteen leaden bullets, of an ounce each, weigh as
much in water as one of a pound, whose superficies
is less.</p>

<p>Therefore the supporting of salt in water is not
owing to its superficies being increased.</p>

<p>A lump of salt, though laid at rest at the bottom of
a vessel of water, will dissolve therein, and its parts
move every way, till equally diffused in the water;
therefore there is a mutual attraction between water
and salt. Every particle of water assumes as many of
salt as can adhere to it; when more is added, it precipitates,
and will not remain suspended.</p>

<p>Water, in the same manner, will dissolve in air,
every particle of air assuming one or more particles
of water. When too much is added, it precipitates
in rain.</p>

<p>But there not being the same contiguity between the
particles of air as of water, the solution of water in air
is not carried on without a motion of the air, so as to
cause a fresh accession of dry particles.</p>

<p>Part of a fluid, having more of what it dissolves,
will communicate to other parts that have less. Thus
very salt water, coming in contact with fresh, communicates
its saltness till all is equal, and the sooner if
there is a little motion of the water.</p>

<p>Even earth will dissolve, or mix with air. A stroke
of a horse's hoof on the ground, in a hot dusty road,
will raise a cloud of dust, that shall, if there be a
light breeze, expand every way, till, perhaps, near as
big as a common house. It is not by mechanical motion
communicated to the particles of dust by the hoof,
that they fly so far, nor by the wind, that they spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
so wide: but the air near the ground, more heated by
the hot dust struck into it, is rarefied and rises, and in
rising mixes with the cooler air, and communicates of
its dust to it, and it is at length so diffused as to become
invisible. Quantities of dust are thus carried up
in dry seasons: showers wash it from the air, and bring
it down again. For water attracting it stronger, it
quits the air, and adheres to the water.</p>

<p>Air, suffering continual changes in the degrees of its
heat, from various causes and circumstances, and, consequently,
changes in its specific gravity, must therefore
be in continual motion.</p>

<p>A small quantity of fire mixed with water (or degree
of heat therein) so weakens the cohesion of its particles,
that those on the surface easily quit it, and adhere
to the particles of air.</p>

<p>A greater degree of heat is required to break the
cohesion between water and air.</p>

<p>Air moderately heated will support a greater quantity
of water invisibly than cold air; for its particles
being by heat repelled to a greater distance from each
other, thereby more easily keep the particles of water
that are annexed to them from running into cohesions
that would obstruct, refract, or reflect the light.</p>

<p>Hence when we breathe in warm air, though the
same quantity of moisture may be taken up from the
lungs, as when we breathe in cold air, yet that moisture
is not so visible.</p>

<p>Water being extremely heated, <em>i.e.</em> to the degree of
boiling, its particles in quitting it so repel each other,
as to take up vastly more space than before, and by
that repellency support themselves, expelling the air
from the space they occupy. That degree of heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
being lessened, they again mutually attract, and having
no air-particles mixed to adhere to, by which they
might be supported and kept at a distance, they instantly
fall, coalesce, and become water again.</p>

<p>The water commonly diffused in our atmosphere
never receives such a degree of heat from the sun, or
other cause, as water has when boiling; it is not,
therefore, supported by such heat, but by adhering
to air.</p>

<p>Water being dissolved in, and adhering to air, that
air will not readily take up oil, because of the mutual
repellency between water and oil.</p>

<p>Hence cold oils evaporate but slowly, the air having
generally a quantity of dissolved water.</p>

<p>Oil being heated extremely, the air that approaches
its surface will be also heated extremely; the water
then quitting it, it will attract and carry off oil, which
can now adhere to it. Hence the quick evaporation
of oil heated to a great degree.</p>

<p>Oil being dissolved in air, the particles to which it
adheres will not take up water.</p>

<p>Hence the suffocating nature of air impregnated
with burnt grease, as from snuffs of candles and the
like. A certain quantity of moisture should be every
moment discharged and taken away from the lungs;
air that has been frequently breathed, is already overloaded,
and, for that reason, can take no more, so will
not answer the end. Greasy air refuses to touch it. In
both cases suffocation for want of the discharge.</p>

<p>Air will attract and support many other substances.</p>

<p>A particle of air loaded with adhering water, or any
other matter, is heavier than before and would descend.</p>

<p>The atmosphere supposed at rest, a loaded descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>ing
particle must act with a force on the particles it
passes between, or meets with, sufficient to overcome,
in some degree, their mutual repellency, and push them
nearer to each other.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="180" height="220" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Thus, supposing the particles A B C D,
and the other near them,
to be at the distance caused by
their mutual repellency (confined
by their common gravity) if A
would descend to E, it must pass between
B and C; when it comes between
B and C, it will be nearer to
them than before, and must either
have pushed them nearer to F and G, contrary to their
mutual repellency, or pass through by a force exceeding
its repellency with them. It then approaches D,
and, to move it out of the way, must act on it with a
force sufficient to overcome its repellency with the two
next lower particles, by which it is kept in its present
situation.</p>

<p>Every particle of air, therefore, will bear any load inferior
to the force of these repulsions.</p>

<p>Hence the support of fogs, mists, clouds.</p>

<p>Very warm air, clear, though supporting a very great
quantity of moisture, will grow turbid and cloudy on
the mixture of a colder air, as foggy turbid air will
grow clear by warming.</p>

<p>Thus the sun shining on a morning fog, dissipates it;
clouds are seen to waste in a sun-shiny day.</p>

<p>But cold condenses and renders visible the vapour;
a tankard or decanter filled with cold water will condense
the moisture of warm clear air on its outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
where it becomes visible as dew, coalesces into drops,
descends in little streams.</p>

<p>The sun heats the air of our atmosphere most near
the surface of the earth; for there, besides the direct
rays, there are many reflections. Moreover, the earth
itself being heated, communicates of its heat to the
neighbouring air.</p>

<p>The higher regions, having only the direct rays of the
sun passing through them, are comparatively very cold.
Hence the cold air on the tops of mountains, and snow
on some of them all the year, even in the torrid zone.
Hence hail in summer.</p>

<p>If the atmosphere were, all of it (both above and below)
always of the same temper as to cold or heat, then
the upper air would always be <em>rarer</em> than the lower,
because the pressure on it is less; consequently lighter,
and therefore would keep its place.</p>

<p>But the upper air may be more condensed by cold,
than the lower air by pressure; the lower more expanded
by heat, than the upper for want of pressure.
In such case the upper air will become the heavier, the
lower the lighter.</p>

<p>The lower region of air being heated and expanded
heaves up, and supports for some time the colder heavier
air above, and will continue to support it while the
equilibrium is kept. Thus water is supported in an inverted
open glass, while the equilibrium is maintained
by the equal pressure upwards of the air below; but the
equilibrium by any means breaking, the water descends
on the heavier side, and the air rises into its place.</p>

<p>The lifted heavy cold air over a heated country, becoming
by any means unequally supported, or unequal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in its weight, the heaviest part descends first, and the
rest follows impetuously. Hence gusts after heats, and
hurricanes in hot climates. Hence the air of gusts and
hurricanes cold, though in hot climes and seasons; it
coming from above.</p>

<p>The cold air descending from above, as it penetrates
our warm region full of watry particles, condenses them,
renders them visible, forms a cloud thick and dark,
overcasting sometimes, at once, large and extensive;
sometimes, when seen at a distance, small at first, gradually
increasing; the cold edge, or surface of the
cloud, condensing the vapours next it, which form
smaller clouds that join it, increase its bulk, it descends
with the wind and its acquired weight, draws nearer
the earth, grows denser with continual additions of water,
and discharges heavy showers.</p>

<p>Small black clouds thus appearing in a clear sky, in
hot climates, portend storms, and warn seamen to hand
their sails.</p>

<p>The earth, turning on its axis in about twenty-four
hours, the equatorial parts must move about fifteen
miles in each minute; in northern and southern latitudes
this motion is gradually less to the poles, and
there nothing.</p>

<p>If there was a general calm over the face of the
globe, it must be by the air's moving in every part as
fast as the earth or sea it covers.</p>

<p>He that sails, or rides, has insensibly the same degree
of motion as the ship or coach with which he is
connected. If the ship strikes the shore, or the coach
stops suddenly, the motion continuing in the man, he is
thrown forward. If a man were to jump from the land
into a swift sailing ship, he would be thrown backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
(or towards the stern) not having at first the motion of
the ship.</p>

<p>He that travels by sea or land, towards the equinoctial,
gradually acquires motion; from it, loses.</p>

<p>But if a man were taken up from latitude 40 (where
suppose the earth's surface to move twelve miles per
minute) and immediately set down at the equinoctial,
without changing the motion he had, his heels would
be struck up, he would fall westward. If taken up from
the equinoctial, and set down in latitude 40, he would
fall eastward.</p>

<p>The air under the equator, and between the tropics,
being constantly heated and rarefied by the sun, rises.
Its place is supplied by air from northern and southern
latitudes, which coming from parts where the earth and
air had less motion, and not suddenly acquiring the
quicker motion of the equatorial earth, appears an east
wind blowing westward; the earth moving from west
to east, and slipping under the air<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, when we ride in a calm, it seems a wind against
us: if we ride with the wind, and faster, even that will
seem a small wind against us.</p>

<p>The air rarefied between the tropics, and rising, must
flow in the higher region north and south. Before it
rose, it had acquired the greatest motion the earth's rotation
could give it. It retains some degree of this motion,
and descending in higher latitudes, where the
earth's motion is less, will appear a westerly wind, yet
tending towards the equatorial parts, to supply the vacancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
occasioned by the air of the lower regions flowing
thitherwards.</p>

<p>Hence our general cold winds are about north west,
our summer cold gusts the same.</p>

<p>The air in sultry weather, though not cloudy, has a
kind of haziness in it, which makes objects at a distance
appear dull and indistinct. This haziness is occasioned
by the great quantity of moisture equally diffused in
that air. When, by the cold wind blowing down
among it, it is condensed into clouds, and falls in rain,
the air becomes purer and clearer. Hence, after gusts,
distant objects appear distinct, their figures sharply
terminated.</p>

<p>Extreme cold winds congeal the surface of the earth,
by carrying off its fire. Warm winds afterwards blowing
over that frozen surface will be chilled by it.
Could that frozen surface be turned under, and a
warmer turned up from beneath it, those warm winds
would not be chilled so much.</p>

<p>The surface of the earth is also sometimes much
heated by the sun: and such heated surface not being
changed heats the air that moves over it.</p>

<p>Seas, lakes, and great bodies of water, agitated by
the winds, continually change surfaces; the cold surface
in winter is turned under by the rolling of the waves,
and a warmer turned up; in summer, the warm is turned
under, and colder turned up. Hence the more equal
temper of sea-water, and the air over it. Hence, in
winter, winds from the sea seem warm, winds from the
land cold. In summer the contrary.</p>

<p>Therefore the lakes north-west of us<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, as they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
not so much frozen, nor so apt to freeze as the earth,
rather moderate than increase the coldness of our winter
winds.</p>

<p>The air over the sea being warmer, and therefore
lighter in winter than the air over the frozen land, may
be another cause of our general N. W. winds, which
blow off to sea at right angles from our North-American
coast. The warm light sea air rising, the heavy
cold land air pressing into its place.</p>

<p>Heavy fluids descending, frequently form eddies, or
whirlpools, as is seen in a funnel, where the water acquires
a circular motion, receding every way from a
centre, and leaving a vacancy in the middle, greatest
above, and lessening downwards, like a speaking trumpet,
its big end upwards.</p>

<p>Air descending, or ascending, may form the same
kind of eddies, or whirlings, the parts of air acquiring
a circular motion, and receding from the middle of the
circle by a centrifugal force, and leaving there a vacancy;
if descending, greatest above, and lessening
downwards; if ascending, greatest below, and lessening
upwards; like a speaking trumpet, standing its big end
on the ground.</p>

<p>When the air descends with violence in some places,
it may rise with equal violence in others, and form both
kinds of whirlwinds.</p>

<p>The air in its whirling motion receding every way
from the centre or axis of the trumpet leaves there a
vacuum, which cannot be filled through the sides, the
whirling air, as an arch, preventing; it must then press
in at the open ends.</p>

<p>The greatest pressure inwards must be at the lower
end, the greatest weight of the surrounding atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
being there. The air entering rises within, and carries
up dust, leaves, and even heavier bodies that happen in
its way, as the eddy, or whirl, passes over land.</p>

<p>If it passes over water, the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere forces up the water into the vacuity,
part of which, by degrees, joins with the whirling air,
and adding weight, and receiving accelerated motion,
recedes still farther from the centre or axis of the
trump, as the pressure lessens; and at last, as the trump
widens, is broken into small particles, and so united
with air as to be supported by it, and become black
clouds at the top of the trump.</p>

<p>Thus these eddies may be whirlwinds at land, water-spouts
at sea. A body of water so raised, may be suddenly
let fall, when the motion, &amp;c. has not strength to
support it, or the whirling arch is broken so as to admit
the air: falling in the sea, it is harmless, unless ships
happen under it; but if in the progressive motion of
the whirl it has moved from the sea, over the land, and
then breaks, sudden, violent, and mischievous torrents
are the consequences.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I find by a word or two in your last<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, that you
are willing to be found fault with; which authorises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>me to let you know what I am at a loss about in your
papers, which is only in the article of the water-spout.
I am in doubt, whether water in bulk, or even broken
into drops, ever ascends into the region of the clouds
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per vorticem</i>; i. e. whether there be, in reality, what I
call a direct water-spout. I make no doubt of direct
and inverted whirl-winds; your description of them,
and the reason of the thing, are sufficient. I am sensible
too, that they are very strong, and often move considerable
weights. But I have not met with any historical
accounts that seem exact enough to remove my
scruples concerning the ascent abovesaid.</p>

<p>Descending spouts (as I take them to be) are many
times seen, as I take it, in the calms, between the sea
and land trade-winds on the coast of Africa. These
contrary winds, or diverging, I can conceive may occasion
them, as it were by suction, making a breach in a
large cloud. But I imagine they have, at the same
time, a tendency to hinder any direct or rising spout,
by carrying off the lower part of the atmosphere as fast
as it begins to rarefy; and yet spouts are frequent here,
which strengthens my opinion, that all of them descend.</p>

<p>But however this be, I cannot conceive a force producible
by the rarefication and condensation of our atmosphere,
in the circumstances of our globe, capable
of carrying water, in large portions, into the region of
the clouds. Supposing it to be raised, it would be too
heavy to continue the ascent beyond a considerable
height, unless parted into small drops; and even then,
by its centrifugal force, from the manner of conveyance,
it would be flung out of the circle, and fall scattered,
like rain.</p>

<p>But I need not expatiate on these matters to you. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have mentioned my objections, and, as truth is my pursuit,
shall be glad to be informed. I have seen few accounts
of these whirl or eddy winds, and as little of the
spouts; and these, especially, lame and poor things to
obtain any certainty by. If you know any thing determinate
that has been observed, I shall hope to hear
from you; as also of any mistake in my thoughts. I
have nothing to object to any other part of your suppositions:
and as to that of the trade-winds, I believe nobody can.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Boston, October 23, 1752.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>In the inclosed, you have all I have to say of that
matter<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. It proved longer than I expected, so that I
was forced to add a cover to it. I confess it looks like
a dispute; but that is quite contrary to my intentions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>The sincerity of friendship and esteem were my motives;
nor do I doubt your scrupling the goodness of
the intention. However, I must confess I cannot tell
exactly how far I was acted by hopes of better information,
in discovering the whole foundation of my opinion,
which, indeed, is but an opinion, as I am very
much at a loss about the validity of the reasons. I have
not been able to differ from you in sentiment concerning
any thing else in your <em>Suppositions</em>. In the present
case I lie open to conviction, and shall be the gainer
when informed. If I am right, you will know that,
without my adding any more. Too much said on a
merely speculative matter, is but a robbery committed
on practical knowledge. Perhaps I am too much
pleased with these dry notions: however, by this you
will see that I think it unreasonable to give you more
trouble about them, than your leisure and inclination
may prompt you to.</p>

<p class="right padr2">I am, &amp;c. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Since my last I considered, that, as I had begun
with the reasons of my dissatisfaction about the ascent
of water in spouts, you would not be unwilling to hear
the whole I have to say, and then you will know what I
rely upon.</p>

<p>What occasioned my thinking all spouts descend, is,
that I found some did certainly do so. A difficulty appeared
concerning the ascent of so heavy a body as
water, by any force I was apprised of, as probably sufficient.
And, above all, a view of Mr. Stuart's portraits
of spouts, in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>.</p>

<p>Some observations on these last will include the
chief part of my difficulties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Mr. Stuart has given us the figures of a number observed
by him in the Mediterranean: all with some
particulars which make for my opinion, if well drawn.</p>

<p>The great spattering, which relators mention in the
water where the spout descends, and which appears in
all his draughts, I conceive to be occasioned by drops
descending very thick and large into the place.</p>

<p>On the place of this spattering, arises the appearance
of a bush, into the centre of which the spout comes
down. This bush I take to be formed by a spray, made
by the force of these drops, which being uncommonly
large, and descending with unusual force by a stream of
wind <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'decending'">descending</ins> from the cloud with them, increases
the height of the spray: which wind being repulsed by
the surface of the waters rebounds and spreads; by
the first raising the spray higher than it otherwise
would go; and by the last making the top of the bush
appear to bend outwards (<em>i. e.</em>) the cloud of spray is
forced off from the trunk of the spout, and falls backward.</p>

<p>The bush does the same where there is no appearance
of a spout reaching it; and is depressed in the middle,
where the spout is expected. This, I imagine, to be
from numerous drops of the spout falling into it, together
with the wind I mentioned, by their descent,
which beat back the rising spray in the centre.</p>

<p>This circumstance, of the bush bending outwards at
the top, seems not to agree with what I call a direct
whirlwind, but consistent with the reversed; for a direct
one would sweep the bush inwards; if, in that case, any
thing of a bush would appear.</p>

<p>The pillar of water, as they call it, from its likeness,
I suppose to be only the end of the spout immersed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the bush, a little blackened by the additional cloud,
and, perhaps, appears to the eye beyond its real bigness,
by a refraction in the bush, and which refraction
may be the cause of the appearance of separation, betwixt
the part in the bush, and that above it. The
part in the bush is cylindrical, as it is above (<em>i. e.</em>) the
bigness the same from the top of the bush to the water.
Instead of this shape, in case of a whirlwind, it
must have been pyramidical.</p>

<p>Another thing remarkable, is, the curve in some of
them: this is easy to conceive, in case of descending
parcels of drops through various winds, at least till the
cloud condenses so fast as to come down, as it were,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uno rivo</i>. But it is harder to me to conceive it in the
ascent of water, that it should be conveyed along, secure
of not leaking or often dropping through the under
side, in the prone part: and, should the water be
conveyed so swiftly, and with such force, up into the
cloud, as to prevent this, it would, by a natural disposition
to move on in a present direction, presently
straiten the curve, raising the shoulder very swiftly, till
lost in the cloud.</p>

<p>Over every one of Stuart's figures, I see a cloud: I
suppose his clouds were first, and then the spout; I do
not know whether it be so with all spouts, but suppose
it is. Now, if whirlwinds carried up the water, I should
expect them in fair weather, but not under a cloud; as
is observable of whirlwinds; they come in fair weather,
not under the shade of a cloud, nor in the night; since
shade cools the air: but, on the contrary, violent winds
often descend from the clouds; strong gusts which occupy
small spaces; and from the higher regions, extensive
hurricanes, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Another thing is the appearance of the spout <em>coming
from</em> the cloud. This I cannot account for on the notion
of a direct spout, but in the real descending one,
it is easy. I take it, that the cloud begins first of all
to pour out drops at that particular spot, or <em>foramen</em>;
and, when that current of drops increases, so as to
force down wind and vapour, the spout becomes so far
as that goes opaque. I take it, that no clouds drop
spouts, but such as make very fast, and happen to condense
in a particular spot, which perhaps is coldest,
and gives a determination downwards, so as to make a
passage through the subjacent atmosphere.</p>

<p>If spouts ascend, it is to carry up the warm rarefied
air below, to let down all and any that is colder above;
and, if so, they must carry it through the cloud they go
into (for that is cold and dense, I imagine) perhaps far
into the higher region, making a wonderful appearance
at a convenient distance to observe it, by the swift rise
of a body of vapour, above the region of the clouds.
But as this has never been observed in any age, if it be
supposeable that is all.</p>

<p>I cannot learn by mariners, that any wind blows towards
a spout more than any other way; but it blows
towards a whirlwind, for a large distance round.</p>

<p>I suppose there has been no instance of the water of
a spout being salt, when coming across any vessel at
sea. I suppose too, that there have been no salt rains;
these would make the case clear.</p>

<p>I suppose it is from some unhappy effects of these
dangerous creatures of nature, that sailors have an universal
dread on them of breaking in their decks, should
they come across them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I imagine spouts, in cold seasons, as Gordon's in the
Downs, prove the descent.</p>

<p><em>Query.</em> Whether there is not always more or less
cloud, first, where a spout appears?</p>

<p>Whether they are not, generally, on the borders of
trade-winds; and whether this is for, or against me?</p>

<p>Whether there be any credible account of a whirlwind's
carrying up all the water in a pool, or small
pond: as when shoal, and the banks low, a strong gust
might be supposed to blow it all out?</p>

<p>Whether a violent tornado, of a small extent, and
other sudden and strong gusts, be not winds from above,
descending nearly perpendicular; and, whether many
that are called whirlwinds at sea, are any other than
these; and so might be called air-spouts, if they were
objects of sight?</p>

<p>I overlooked, in its proper place, Stuart's No. 11,
which is curious for its inequalities, and, in particular,
the approach to breaking, which, if it would not be too
tedious, I would have observed a little upon, in my own
way, as, I think, this would argue against the ascent,
&amp;c. but I must pass it, not only for the reason mentioned,
but want of room besides.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Stuart's ocular demonstration of the ascent
in his great perpendicular spout, the only one it appears
in, I say, as to this, what I have written supposes him
mistaken, which, yet, I am far from asserting.</p>

<p>The force of an airy vortex, having less influence on
the solid drops of water, than on the interspersed cloudy
vapours, makes the last whirl round swifter, though it
descend slower: and this might easily deceive, without
great care, the most unprejudiced person.</p>

<h3><em>Water-Spouts and Whirlwinds compared.</em></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, June 24, 1756.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Feb. 4, 1753.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I ought to have written to you, long since, in answer
to yours of October 16, concerning the water-spout;
but business partly, and partly a desire of procuring
further information, by enquiry among my seafaring
acquaintance, induced me to postpone writing,
from time to time, till I am now almost ashamed to resume
the subject, not knowing but you may have forgot
what has been said upon it.</p>

<p>Nothing certainly, can be more improving to a
searcher into nature, than objections judiciously made
to his opinion, taken up, perhaps, too hastily: for such
objections oblige him to re-study the point, consider
every circumstance carefully, compare facts, make experiments,
weigh arguments, and be slow in drawing
conclusions. And hence a sure advantage results; for
he either confirms a truth, before too slightly supported;
or discovers an error, and receives instruction
from the objector.</p>

<p>In this view I consider the objections and remarks
you sent me, and thank you for them sincerely: but,
how much soever my inclinations lead me to philosophical
enquiries, I am so engaged in business, public
and private, that those more pleasing pursuits are frequently
interrupted, and the chain of thought, necessary
to be closely continued in such disquisitions, is so
broken and disjointed, that it is with difficulty I satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
myself in any of them: and I am now not much nearer
a conclusion, in this matter of the spout, than when I
first read your letter.</p>

<p>Yet, hoping we may, in time, sift out the truth between
us, I will send you my present thoughts, with
some observations on your reasons on the accounts in
the <cite>Transactions</cite>, and on other relations I have met with.
Perhaps, while I am writing, some new light may strike
me, for I shall now be obliged to consider the subject
with a little more attention.</p>

<p>I agree with you, that, by means of a vacuum in a
whirlwind, water cannot be supposed to rise in large
masses to the region of the clouds; for the pressure of
the surrounding atmosphere could not force it up in a
continued body, or column, to a much greater height,
than thirty feet. But, if there really is a vacuum in the
centre, or near the axis of whirlwinds, then, I think,
water may rise in such vacuum to that height, or to a
less height, as the vacuum may be less perfect.</p>

<p>I had not read Stuart's account, in the <cite>Transactions</cite>,
for many years, before the receipt of your letter, and
had quite forgot it; but now, on viewing his draughts,
and considering his descriptions, I think they seem to
favour <em>my hypothesis</em>; for he describes and draws columns
of water, of various heights, terminating abruptly
at the top, exactly as water would do, when forced up
by the pressure of the atmosphere into an exhausted tube.</p>

<p>I must, however, no longer call it <em>my hypothesis</em>, since
I find Stuart had the same thought, though somewhat
obscurely expressed, where he says, "he imagines this
phenomenon may be solved by suction (improperly so
called) or rather pulsion, as in the application of a cupping
glass to the flesh, the air being first voided by the
kindled flax."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
In my paper, I supposed a whirlwind and a spout to
be the same thing, and to proceed from the same
cause; the only difference between them being, that
the one passes over land, the other over water, I find,
also, in the <cite>Transactions</cite>, that M. de la Pryme was of
the same opinion; for he there describes two spouts, as
he calls them, which were seen at different times, at
Hatfield, in Yorkshire, whose appearances in the air
were the same with those of the spouts at sea, and effects
the same with those of real whirlwinds.</p>

<p>Whirlwinds have generally a progressive, as well as
a circular motion; so had what is called the spout, at
Topsham&mdash;(<em>See the account of it in the Transactions</em>)
which also appears, by its effects described, to have been
a real whirlwind. Water-spouts have, also, a progressive
motion; this is sometimes greater, and sometimes
less; in some violent, in others barely perceivable. The
whirlwind at Warrington continued long in Acrement-Close.</p>

<p>Whirlwinds generally arise after calms and great
heats: the same is observed of water-spouts, which are,
therefore, most frequent in the warm latitudes. The
spout that happened in cold weather, in the Downs,
described by Mr. Gordon in the <cite>Transactions</cite>, was, for
that reason, thought extraordinary; but he remarks
withal, that the weather, though cold when the spout
appeared, was soon after much colder; as we find it,
commonly, less warm after a whirlwind.</p>

<p>You agree, that the wind blows every way towards a
whirlwind, from a large space round. An intelligent
whaleman of Nantucket, informed me that three of their
vessels, which were out in search of whales, happening
to be becalmed, lay in sight of each other, at about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
league distance, if I remember right, nearly forming a
triangle: after some time, a water-spout appeared near
the middle of the triangle, when a brisk breeze of wind
sprung up, and every vessel made sail; and then it appeared
to them all, by the setting of the sails, and the
course each vessel stood, that the spout was to the leeward
of every one of them; and they all declared it to
have been so, when they happened afterwards in company,
and came to confer about it. So that in this particular
likewise, whirlwinds and water-spouts agree.</p>

<p>But, if that which appears a water-spout at sea, does
sometimes, in its progressive motion, meet with and
pass over land, and there produce all the phenomena
and effects of a whirlwind, it should thence seem still
more evident, that a whirlwind and a spout are the
same. I send you, herewith, a letter from an ingenious
physician of my acquaintance, which gives one instance
of this, that fell within his observation.</p>

<p>A fluid, moving from all points horizontally, towards
a centre, must, at that centre, either ascend or descend.
Water being in a tub, if a hole be opened in the middle
of the bottom, will flow from all sides to the centre,
and there descend in a whirl. But, air flowing on and
near the surface of land or water, from all sides, towards
a centre, must, at that centre ascend; the land
or water hindering its descent.</p>

<p>If these concentring currents of air be in the upper
region, they may, indeed, descend in the spout or whirlwind;
but then, when the united current reached the
earth or water, it would spread, and, probably, blow
every way from the centre. There may be whirlwinds
of both kinds, but from the commonly observed effects,
I suspect the rising one to be the most common: when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the upper air descends, it is, perhaps, in a greater body,
extending wider, as in our thunder-gusts, and without
much whirling; and, when air descends in a spout, or
whirlwind, I should rather expect it would press the
roof of a house <em>inwards</em>, or force <em>in</em> the tiles, shingles,
or thatch, force a boat down into the water, or a piece
of timber into the earth, than that it would lift them
up, and carry them away.</p>

<p>It has so happened, that I have not met with any accounts
of spouts, that certainly descended; I suspect
they are not frequent. Please to communicate those
you mention. The apparent dropping of a pipe from
the clouds towards the earth or sea, I will endeavour to
explain hereafter.</p>

<p>The augmentation of the cloud, which, as I am informed,
is generally, if not always the case, during a
spout, seems to shew an ascent, rather than a descent
of the matter of which such cloud is composed; for a
descending spout, one would expect, should diminish a
cloud. I own, however, that cold air descending, may,
by condensing the vapours in a lower region, form and
increase clouds; which, I think, is generally the case
in our common thunder-gusts, and, therefore, do not
lay great stress on this argument.</p>

<p>Whirlwinds and spouts, are not always, though most
commonly, in the day time. The terrible whirlwind
which damaged a great part of Rome, June 11, 1749,
happened in the night of that day. The same was supposed
to have been first a spout, for it is said to be beyond
doubt, that it gathered in the neighbouring sea,
as it could be tracked from Ostia to Rome. I find this
in Pere Boschovich's account of it, as abridged in the
Monthly Review for December 1750.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
In that account, the whirlwind is said to have appeared
as a very black, long, and lofty cloud, discoverable,
notwithstanding the darkness of the night, by its
continually lightning or emitting flashes on all sides,
pushing along with a surprising swiftness, and within
three or four feet of the ground. Its general effects on
houses, were stripping off the roofs, blowing away
chimneys, breaking doors and windows, <em>forcing up the
floors, and unpaving the rooms</em> (some of these effects
seem to agree well with a supposed vacuum in the centre
of the whirlwind) and the very rafters of the houses
were broken and dispersed, and even hurled against
houses at a considerable distance, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It seems, by an expression of Pere Boschovich's, as
if the wind blew from all sides towards the whirlwind;
for, having carefully observed its effects, he concludes
of all whirlwinds, "that their motion is circular, and
their action attractive."</p>

<p>He observes, on a number of histories of whirlwinds,
&amp;c. "that a common effect of them is, to carry up into
the air, tiles, stones, and animals themselves, which
happen to be in their course, and all kinds of bodies
unexceptionably, throwing them to a considerable distance,
with great impetuosity."</p>

<p>Such effects seem to shew a rising current of air.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to explain my conceptions of this
matter by figures, representing a plan and an elevation
of a spout or whirlwind.</p>

<p>I would only first beg to be allowed two or three positions,
mentioned in my former paper.</p>

<p>1. That the lower region of air is often more heated,
and so more rarefied, than the upper; consequently,
specifically lighter. The coldness of the upper region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is manifested by the hail which sometimes falls from it
in a hot day.</p>

<p>2. That heated air may be very moist, and yet the
moisture so equally diffus'd and rarefied, as not to be
visible, till colder air mixes with it, when it condenses,
and becomes visible. Thus our breath, invisible in
summer, becomes visible in winter.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose a tract of land, or sea, of perhaps
sixty miles square, unscreened by clouds, and unfanned
by winds, during great part of a summer's day, or, it
may be, for several days successively, till it is violently
heated, together with the lower region of air in contact
with it, so that the said lower air becomes specifically
lighter than the superincumbent higher region of the
atmosphere, in which the clouds commonly float: let us
suppose, also, that the air surrounding this tract has not
been so much heated during those days, and, therefore,
remains heavier. The consequence of this should be,
as I conceive, that the heated lighter air, being pressed
on all sides, must ascend, and the heavier descend; and,
as this rising cannot be in all parts, or the whole area
of the tract at once, for that would leave too extensive
a vacuum, the rising will begin precisely in that column
that happens to be the lightest, or most rarefied; and
the warm air will flow horizontally from all points to
this column, where the several currents meeting, and
joining to rise, a whirl is naturally formed, in the same
manner as a whirl is formed in the tub of water, by the
descending fluid flowing from all sides of the tub, to
the hole in the centre.</p>

<p>And, as the several currents arrive at this central
rising column, with a considerable degree of horizontal
motion, they cannot suddenly change it to a vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
motion; therefore as they gradually, in approaching
the whirl, decline from right to curve or circular lines,
so, having joined the whirl, they <em>ascend</em> by a spiral motion,
in the same manner as the water <em>descends</em> spirally
through the hole in the tub before-mentioned.</p>

<p>Lastly, as the lower air, and nearest the surface, is
most rarefied by the heat of the sun, that air is most
acted on by the pressure of the surrounding cold and
heavy air, which is to take its place; consequently, its
motion towards the whirl is swiftest, and so the force of
the lower part of the whirl, or trump, strongest, and the
centrifugal force of its particles greatest; and hence
the vacuum round the axis of the whirl should be greatest
near the earth or sea, and be gradually diminished
as it approaches the region of the clouds, till it ends in
a point, as at P in Fig. II. <a href="#PLATE_V">Plate V.</a> forming a long and
sharp cone.</p>

<p>In Fig. I. which is a plan or ground-plat of a whirlwind,
the circle V. represents the central vacuum.</p>

<p>Between <em>a a a a</em> and <em>b b b b</em> I suppose a body of air,
condensed strongly by the pressure of the currents
moving towards it, from all sides without, and by its
centrifugal force from within, moving round with prodigious
swiftness, (having, as it were, the momenta of
all the currents &mdash;&mdash;> &mdash;&mdash;>  &mdash;&mdash;> &mdash;&mdash;>
united in itself) and with a power equal to its swiftness
and density.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>It is this whirling body of air between <em>a a a a</em> and
<em>b b b b</em> that rises spirally; by its force it tears buildings
to pieces, twists up great trees by the roots, &amp;c. and,
by its spiral motion, raises the fragments so high, till
the pressure of the surrounding and approaching currents
diminishing, can no longer confine them to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>circle, or their own centrifugal force encreasing, grows
too strong for such pressure, when they fly off in tangent
lines, as stones out of a sling, and fall on all sides,
and at great distances.</p>

<p>If it happens at sea, the water under and between
<em>a a a a</em> and <em>b b b b</em> will be violently agitated and driven
about, and parts of it raised with the spiral current,
and thrown about so as to form a bush-like appearance.</p>

<p>This circle is of various diameters, sometimes very
large.</p>

<p>If the vacuum passes over water, the water may rise
in it in a body, or column, to near the height of thirty-two
feet.</p>

<p>If it passes over houses, it may burst their windows
or walls outwards, pluck off the roofs, and pluck up
the floors, by the sudden rarefaction of the air contained
within such buildings; the outward pressure of
the atmosphere being suddenly taken off: so the stopped
bottle of air bursts under the exhausted receiver
of the air-pump.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. II.</span> is to represent the elevation of a water-spout,
wherein I suppose P P P to be the cone, at first
a vacuum, till W W, the rising column of water, has
filled so much of it. S S S S, the spiral whirl of air,
surrounding the vacuum, and continued higher in a
close column after the vacuum ends in the point P, till
it reaches the cool region of the air. B B, the bush
described by Stuart, surrounding the foot of the column
of water.</p>

<p>Now, I suppose this whirl of air will, at first, be
as invisible as the air itself, though reaching, in reality,
from the water, to the region of cool air, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
which our low summer thunder-clouds commonly float;
but presently it will become visible at its extremities.
<em>At its lower end</em>, by the agitation of the water, under
the whirling part of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'cirle'">circle</ins>, between P and S forming
Stuart's bush, and by the swelling and rising of the
water, in the beginning vacuum, which is, at first, a
small, low, broad cone, whose top gradually rises and
sharpens, as the force of the whirl encreases. <em>At its
upper end</em> it becomes visible, by the warm air brought
up to the cooler region, where its moisture begins to
be condensed into thick vapour, by the cold, and is seen
first at A, the highest part, which being now cooled,
condenses what rises next at B, which condenses that at
C, and that condenses what is rising at D, the cold operating
by the contact of the vapours faster in a right
line downwards, than the vapours themselves can climb
in a spiral line upwards; they climb, however, and as
by continual addition they grow denser, and, consequently,
their centrifugal force greater, and being risen
above the concentrating currents that compose the
whirl, fly off, spread, and form a cloud.</p>

<p>It seems easy to conceive, how, by this successive
condensation from above, the spout appears to drop
or descend from the cloud, though the materials of
which it is composed are all the while ascending.</p>

<p>The condensation of the moisture, contained in so
great a quantity of warm air as may be supposed to
rise in a short time in this prodigiously rapid whirl, is,
perhaps, sufficient to form a great extent of cloud,
though the spout should be over land, as those at
Hatfield; and if the land happens not to be very dusty,
perhaps the lower part of the spout will scarce become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
visible at all; though the upper, or what is commonly
called the descending part, be very distinctly seen.</p>

<p>The same may happen at sea, in case the whirl is
not violent enough to make a high vacuum, and raise
the column, &amp;c. In such case, the upper part A B C D
only will be visible, and the bush, perhaps, below.</p>

<p>But if the whirl be strong, and there be much dust
on the land, and the column W W be raised from the
water, then the lower part becomes visible, and sometimes
even united to the upper part. For the dust may
be carried up in the spiral whirl, till it reach the region
where the vapour is condensed, and rise with that even
to the clouds: and the friction of the whirling air, on
the sides of the column W W, may detach great quantities
of its water, break it into drops, and carry them
up in the spiral whirl mixed with the air; the heavier
drops may, indeed, fly off, and fall, in a shower, round
the spout; but much of it will be broken into vapour,
yet visible; and thus, in both cases, by dust at land,
and, by water at sea, the whole tube may be darkened
and rendered visible.</p>

<p>As the whirl weakens, the tube may (in appearance)
separate in the middle; the column of water subsiding,
and the superior condensed part drawing up to the
cloud. Yet still the tube, or whirl of air, may remain
entire, the middle only becoming invisible, as not containing
visible matter.</p>

<p>Dr. Stuart says, "It was observable of all the spouts
he saw, but more perceptible of the great one; that;
towards the end, it began to appear like a hollow canal,
only black in the borders, but white in the middle;
and though at first it was altogether black and
opaque, yet, now, one could very distinctly perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the sea-water to fly up along the middle of this canal,
as smoak up a chimney."</p>

<p>And Dr. Mather, describing a whirlwind, says, "a
thick dark small cloud arose, with a pillar of light in
it, of about eight or ten feet diameter, and passed along
the ground in a tract not wider than a street, horribly
tearing up trees by the roots, blowing them up in the
air like feathers, and throwing up stones of great weight
to a considerable height in the air, &amp;c."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="300" height="270" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These accounts, the one of water-spouts, the other
of a whirlwind, seem, in this particular, to agree;
what one gentleman describes as a tube, black in the
borders, and white in the middle, the other calls a
black cloud, with a pillar of light in it; the latter expression
has only a little more of the <em>marvellous</em>, but
the thing is the same; and it seems not very difficult to
understand. When Dr. Stuart's spouts were full charged,
that is, when the whirling pipe of air was filled between
<em>a a a a</em> and <em>b b b b</em>, Fig. I., with quantities of
drops, and vapour torn off from the column W W,
Fig. II., the
whole was
rendered so
dark, as that
it could not
be seen
thro', nor
the spiral
ascending
motion discovered;
but when
the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
ascending lessened, the pipe became more transparent,
and the ascending motion visible. For, by inspection
of the figure in the opposite page, representing a section
of our spout, with the vacuum in the middle, it is
plain that if we look at such a hollow pipe in the direction
of the arrows, and suppose opaque particles to be equally
mixed in the space between the two circular lines,
both the part between the arrows <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, and that between
the arrows <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>, will appear much darker than
that between <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, as there must be many more of
those opaque particles in the line of vision across the
sides, than across the middle. It is thus that a hair in
a microscope evidently appears to be a pipe, the sides
shewing darker than the middle. Dr. Mather's whirl
was probably filled with dust, the sides were very dark,
but the vacuum within rendering the middle more transparent,
he calls it a pillar of light.</p>

<p>It was in this more transparent part, between <em>b</em> and
<em>c</em>, that Stuart could see the spiral motion of the vapours,
whose lines on the nearest and farthest side of
the transparent part crossing each other, represented
smoak ascending in a chimney; for the quantity being
still too great in the line of sight through the sides of
the tube, the motion could not be discovered there,
and so they represented the solid sides of the chimney.</p>

<p>When the vapours reach in the pipe from the clouds
near to the earth, it is no wonder now to those who
understand electricity, that flashes of lightning should
descend by the spout, as in that of Rome.</p>

<p>But you object, if water may be thus carried into
the clouds, why have we not salt rains? The objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
is strong and reasonable, and I know not whether I
can answer it to your satisfaction. I never heard but
of one salt rain, and that was where a spout passed
pretty near a ship, so I suppose it to be only the drops
thrown off from the spout, by the centrifugal force (as
the birds were at Hatfield) when they had been carried
so high as to be above, or to be too strongly centrifugal
for, the pressure of the concurring winds surrounding
it: and, indeed, I believe there can be no
other kind of salt rain; for it has pleased the goodness
of God so to order it, that the particles of air will
not attract the particles of salt, though they strongly
attract water.</p>

<p>Hence, though all metals, even gold, may be united
with air, and rendered volatile, salt remains fixt in the
fire, and no heat can force it up to any considerable
height, or oblige the air to hold it. Hence, when salt
rises, as it will a little way, into air with water, there
is instantly a separation made; the particles of water
adhere to the air, and the particles of salt fall down
again, as if repelled and forced off from the water by
some power in the air; or, as some metals, dissolved
in a proper menstruum, will quit the solvent when other
matter approaches, and adhere to that, so the water
quits the salt, and embraces the air; but air will not
embrace the salt, and quit the water, otherwise our
rains would indeed be salt, and every tree and plant
on the face of the earth be destroyed, with all the animals
that depend on them for subsistence.&mdash;&mdash;He
who hath proportioned and given proper qualities to all
things, was not unmindful of this. Let us adore <span class="smcap">Him</span>
with praise and thanksgiving!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
By some accounts of seamen, it seems the column of
water W W, sometimes falls suddenly; and if it be,
as some say, fifteen or twenty yards diameter, it must
fall with great force, and they may well fear for their
ships. By one account, in the <cite>Transactions</cite>, of a spout
that fell at Colne in Lancashire, one would think the
column is sometimes lifted off from the water, and carried
over land, and there let fall in a body; but this,
I suppose, happens rarely.</p>

<p>Stuart describes his spouts as appearing no bigger
than a mast, and sometimes less; but they were seen
at a league and a half distance.</p>

<p>I think I formerly read in Dampier, or some other
voyager, that a spout, in its progressive motion, went
over a ship becalmed, on the coast of Guinea, and first
threw her down on one side, carrying away her foremast,
then suddenly whipped her up, and threw her
down on the other side, carrying away her mizen-mast,
and the whole was over in an instant. I suppose the
first mischief was done by the fore-side of the whirl,
the latter by the hinder-side, their motion being contrary.</p>

<p>I suppose a whirlwind, or spout, may be stationary,
when the concurring winds are equal; but if unequal,
the whirl acquires a progressive motion, in the direction
of the strongest pressure.</p>

<p>When the wind that gives the progressive motion
becomes stronger below than above, or above than
below, the spout will be bent, and, the cause ceasing,
straiten again.</p>

<p>Your queries, towards the end of your paper, appear
judicious, and worth considering. At present I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
am not furnished with facts sufficient to make any pertinent
answer to them; and this paper has already a sufficient
quantity of conjecture.</p>

<p>Your manner of accommodating the accounts to
your hypothesis of descending spouts, is, I own, ingenious,
and perhaps that hypothesis may be true. I will
consider it farther, but, as yet, I am not satisfied with
it, though hereafter I may be.</p>

<p>Here you have my method of accounting for the
principal phenomena, which I submit to your candid
examination.</p>

<p>And as I now seem to have almost written a book,
instead of a letter, you will think it high time I should
conclude; which I beg leave to do, with assuring you,
that</p>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, June 24, 1756.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>New-Brunswick, November 11, 1752.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I am favoured with your letter of the 2d instant,
and shall, with pleasure, comply with your request, in
describing (as well as my memory serves me) the water-spout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I saw at Antigua; and shall think this, or any
other service I can do, well repaid, if it contributes to
your satisfaction in so curious a disquisition.</p>

<p>I had often seen water-spouts at a distance, and
heard many strange stories of them, but never knew
any thing satisfactory of their nature or cause, until
that which I saw at Antigua; which convinced me that
a water-spout is a whirlwind, which becomes visible in
all its dimensions by the water it carries up with it.</p>

<p>There appeared, not far from the mouth of the harbour
of St. John's, two or three water-spouts, one of
which took its course up the harbour. Its progressive
motion was slow and unequal, not in a strait line, but,
as it were, by jerks or starts. When just by the wharf,
I stood about one hundred yards from it. There appeared
in the water a circle of about twenty yards diameter,
which, to me, had a dreadful, though pleasing
appearance. The water in this circle was violently agitated,
being whisked about, and carried up into the air
with great rapidity and noise, and reflected a lustre, as
if the sun shined bright on that spot, which was more
conspicuous, as there appeared a dark circle around it.
When it made the shore, it carried up with the same
violence shingles, staves<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, large pieces of the roofs of
houses, &amp;c. and one small wooden house it lifted entire
from the foundation on which it stood, and carried it to
the distance of fourteen feet, where it settled without
breaking or oversetting; and, what is remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
though the whirlwind moved from west to east, the
house moved from east to west. Two or three negroes
and a white woman, were killed by the fall of timber,
which it carried up into the air and dropped again.
After passing through the town, I believe it was soon
dissipated; for, except tearing a large limb from a tree,
and part of the cover of a sugar-work near the town, I
do not remember any farther damage done by it. I
conclude, wishing you success in your enquiry,</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Boston, May 14, 1753.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I received your letter of April last, and thank
you for it. Several things in it make me at a loss which
side the truth lies on, and determine me to wait for farther
evidence.</p>

<p>As to shooting-stars, as they are called, I know very
little, and hardly know what to say. I imagine them
to be passes of electric fire from place to place in the
atmosphere, perhaps occasioned by accidental pressures
of a non-electric circumambient fluid, and so by propulsion,
or allicited by the circumstance of a distant
quantity <em>minus</em> electrified, which it shoots to supply,
and becomes apparent by its contracted passage through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a non-electric medium. Electric fire in our globe is
always in action, sometimes ascending, descending, or
passing from region to region. I suppose it avoids too
dry air, and therefore we never see these shoots ascend.
It always has freedom enough to pass down unobserved,
but, I imagine, not always so, to pass to distant climes
and meridians less stored with it.</p>

<p>The shoots are sometimes all one way, which, in the
last case, they should be.</p>

<p>Possibly there may be collections of particles in our
atmosphere, which gradually form, by attraction, either
similar ones <em>per se</em>, or dissimilar particles, by the intervention
of others. But then, whether they shoot or
explode of themselves, or by the approach of some suitable
foreign collection, accidentally brought near by
the usual commotions and interchanges of our atmosphere,
especially when the higher and lower regions
intermix, before change of winds and weather, I leave.</p>

<p>I believe I have now said enough of what I know
nothing about. If it should serve for your amusement,
or any way oblige you, it is all I aim at, and shall, at
your desire, be always ready to say what I think, as I
am sure of your candour.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Water-Spouts and Whirlwinds.</em></a></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, July 8, 1756.</p>

<p>Spouts have been generally believed ascents of
water from below, to the region of the clouds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
whirlwinds the means of conveyance. The world has
been very well satisfied with these opinions, and prejudiced
with respect to any observations about them.
Men of learning and capacity have had many opportunities
in passing those regions where these phenomena
were most frequent, but seem industriously to have declined
any notice of them, unless to escape danger, as
a matter of mere impertinence in a case so clear and
certain as their nature and manner of operation are
taken to be. Hence it has been very difficult to get
any tolerable accounts of them. None but those they
fell near can inform us any thing to be depended on;
three or four such instances follow, where the vessels
were so near, that their crews could not avoid knowing
something remarkable with respect to the matters in
question.</p>

<p>Capt. John Wakefield, junior, passing the Straits of
Gibraltar, had one fall by the side of his ship; it came
down of a sudden, as they think, and all agree the descent
was certain.</p>

<p>Captain Langstaff, on a voyage to the West Indies,
had one come across the stern of his vessel, and passed
away from him. The water came down in such quantity
that the present Captain Melling, who was then a
common sailor at helm, says it almost drowned him,
running into his mouth, nose, ears, &amp;c. and adds, that
it tasted perfectly fresh.</p>

<p>One passed by the side of Captain Howland's ship,
so near that it appeared pretty plain that the water descended
from first to last.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Spring was so near one in the Straits of
Malacca, that he could perceive it to be a small very
thick rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>All these assure me, that there was no wind drawing
towards them, nor have I found any others that have
observed such a wind.</p>

<p>It seems plain, by these few instances, that whirlwinds
do not always attend spouts; and that the water
really descends in some of them. But the following
consideration, in confirmation of this opinion, may,
perhaps, render it probable that all the spouts are
descents.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely that there should be two sorts of
spouts, one ascending and the other descending.</p>

<p>It has not yet been proved that any one spout ever
ascended. A specious appearance is all that can be
produced in favour of this; and those who have been
most positive about it, were at more than a league's distance
when they observed, as Stuart and others, if I am
not mistaken. However, I believe it impossible to be
certain whether water ascends or descends at half the
distance.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to consider the places where
they happen most. These are such as are liable to
calms from departing winds on both sides, as on the
borders of the equinoctial trade, calms on the coast of
Guinea, in the Straits of Malacca, &amp;c. places where the
under region of the atmosphere is drawn off horizontally.
I think they do not come where the calms are
without departing winds; and I take the reason to be,
that such places, and places where winds blow towards
one another, are liable to whirlwinds, or other ascents
of the lower region, which I suppose contrary to spouts.
But the former are liable to descents, which I take to
be necessary to their production. Agreeable to this, it
seems reasonable to believe, that any Mediterranean sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
should be more subject to spouts than others. The sea
usually so called is so. The Straits of Malacca is.
Some large gulphs may probably be so, in suitable latitudes;
so the Red Sea, &amp;c. and all for this reason, that
the heated lands on each side draw off the under
region of the air, and make the upper descend, whence
sudden and wonderful condensations may take place,
and make these descents.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that the manner of their appearance
and procedure, favour the notion of a descent.</p>

<p>More or less of a cloud, as I am informed, always
appears over the place first; then a spattering on the
surface of the water below; and when this is advanced
to a considerable degree, the spout emerges from the
cloud, and descends, and that, if the causes are sufficient,
down to the places of spattering, with a roaring in
proportion to the quantity of the discharge; then it
abates, or stops, sometimes more gradually, sometimes
more suddenly.</p>

<p>I must observe a few things on these particulars, to
shew how I think they agree with my hypothesis.</p>

<p>The preceding cloud over the place shews condensation,
and, consequently, tendency downwards, which
therefore must naturally prevent any ascent. Besides
that, so far as I can learn, a whirlwind never comes under
a cloud, but in a clear sky.</p>

<p>The spattering may be easily conceived to be caused
by a stream of drops, falling with great force on the
place, imagining the spout to begin so, when a sudden
and great condensation happens in a contracted space,
as the Ox-Eye on the coast of Guinea.</p>

<p>The spout appearing to descend from the cloud seems
to be, by the stream of nearly contiguous drops bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>ing
the air into consent, so as to carry down a quantity
of the vapour of the cloud; and the pointed appearance
it makes may be from the descending course being
swiftest in the middle, or centre of the spout: this naturally
drawing the outer parts inward, and the centre
to a point; and that will appear foremost that moves
swiftest. The phenomenon of retiring and advancing,
I think may be accounted for, by supposing the progressive
motion to exceed or not equal the consumption
of the vapour by condensation. Or more plainly
thus: the descending vapour which forms the apparent
spout, if it be slow in its progress downwards, is condensed
as fast as it advances, and so appears at a stand;
when it is condensed faster than it advances, it appears
to retire; and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>Its duration, and manner of ending, are as the
causes, and may vary by several accidents.</p>

<p>The cloud itself may be so circumstanced as to stop
it; as when, extending wide, it weighs down at a distance
round about, while a small circle at the spout being
exonerated by the discharge ascends and shuts up the
passage. A new determination of wind may, perhaps,
stop it too. Places liable to these appearances are very
liable to frequent and sudden alterations of it.</p>

<p>Such accidents as a clap of thunder, firing cannon,
&amp;c. may stop them, and the reason may be, that any
shock of this kind may occasion the particles that are
near cohering, immediately to do so; and then the whole,
thus condensed, falls at once (which is what I suppose
is vulgarly called the breaking of the spout) and in the
interval, between this period and that of the next set of
particles being ready to unite, the spout shuts up. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that if this reasoning is just, these phenomena agree
with my hypothesis.</p>

<p>The usual temper of the air, at the time of their appearance,
if I have a right information, is for me to;
it being then pretty cool for the season and climate;
and this is worth remark, because cool air is weighty,
and will not ascend; besides, when the air grows cool,
it shews that the upper region descends, and conveys
this temper down; and when the tempers are equal, no
whirlwind can take place. But spouts have been
known, when the lower region has been really cold.
Gordon's spout in the Downs is an instance of this&mdash;(<em>Vide</em>
<cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>)&mdash;where the upper region
was probably not at all cooler, if so cold as the
lower: it was a cold day in the month of March, hail
followed, but not snow, and it is observable, that not
so much as hail follows or accompanies them in moderate
seasons or climes, when and where they are most
frequent. However, it is not improbable, that just
about the place of descent may be cooler than the neighbouring
parts, and so favour the wonderful celerity of
condensation. But, after all, should we allow the under
region to be ever so much the hottest, and a whirlwind
to take place in it: suppose then the sea-water to ascend,
it would certainly cool the spout, and then, query,
whether it would not very much, if not wholly, obstruct
its progress.</p>

<p>It commonly rains when spouts disappear, if it did
not before, which it frequently does not, by the best
accounts I have had; but the cloud encreases much
faster after they disappear, and it soon rains. The first
shews the spout to be a contracted rain, instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
diffused one that follows; and the latter that the cloud
was not formed by ascending water, for then it would
have ceased growing when the spout vanished.</p>

<p>However, it seems that spouts have sometimes appeared
after it began to rain; but this is one way a
proof of my hypothesis, viz. as whirlwinds do not come
under a cloud.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention, that the increase of cloud,
while the spout subsists, is no argument of an ascent of
water, by the spout. Since thunder-clouds sometimes
encrease greatly while it rains very hard.</p>

<p>Divers effects of spouts seem not so well accounted
for any other way as by descent.</p>

<p>The bush round the feet of them seems to be a great
spray of water made by the violence of descent, like
that in great falls of water from high precipices.</p>

<p>The great roar, like some vast inland falls, is so different
from the roar of whirlwinds, by all acounts, as to
be no ways compatible.</p>

<p>The throwing things from it with great force, instead
of carrying them up into the air, is another difference.</p>

<p>There seems some probability that the sailors traditionary
belief, that spouts may break in their decks, and
so destroy vessels, might originate from some facts of
that sort in former times. This danger is apparent on
my hypothesis, but it seems not so on the other: and
my reason for it is, that the whole column of a spout
from the sea to the clouds, cannot, in a natural way,
even upon the largest supposition, support more than
about three feet water, and from truly supposeable
causes, not above one foot, as may appear more plainly
by and by. Supposing now the largest of these quantities
to rise, it must be disseminated into drops, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the surface of the sea to the region of the clouds, or
higher; for this reason it is quite unlikely to be collected
into masses, or a body, upon its falling; but
would descend in progression according to the several
degrees of altitude the different portions had arrived at
when it received this new determination.</p>

<p>Now that there cannot more rise upon the common
hypothesis than I have mentioned, may appear probable,
if we attend to the only efficient cause in supposed
ascending spouts, viz. whirlwinds.</p>

<p>We know that the rarefaction of the lower, and the
condensation of the upper region of air, are the only
natural causes of whirlwinds. Let us then suppose the
former as hot as their greatest summer heat in England,
and the latter as cold as the extent of their winter.
These extremes have been found there to alter the
weight of the air one-tenth, which is equal to a little
more than three feet water. Were this case possible,
and a whirlwind take place in it, it might act with a
force equal to the mentioned difference. But as this
is the whole strength, so much water could not rise;
therefore to allow it due motion upwards, we must
abate, at least, one-fourth part, perhaps more, to give
it such a swift ascension as some think usual. But here
several difficulties occur, at least they are so to me.
As, whether this quantity would render the spout
opaque? since it is plain that in drops it could not do
so. How, or by what means it may be reduced small
enough? or, if the water be not reduced into vapour,
what will suspend it in the region of the clouds when
exonerated there? And, if vapourized while ascending,
how can it be dangerous by what they call the breaking?
For it is difficult to conceive how a condensative power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
should instantaneously take place of a rarefying and
disseminating one.</p>

<p>The sudden fall of the spout, or rather, the sudden
ceasing of it, I accounted for, in my way, before. But
it seems necessary to mention something I then forgot.
Should it be said to do so (<em>i. e.</em>) to fall, because all
the lower rarefied air is ascended, whence the whirlwind
must cease, and its burden drop; I cannot agree
to this, unless the air be observed on a sudden to have
grown much colder, which I cannot learn has been the
case. Or should it be supposed that the spout was, on
a sudden, obstructed at the top, and this the cause of
the fall, however plausible this might appear, yet no
more water would fall than what was at the same time
contained in the column, which is often, by many and
satisfactory accounts to me, again far from being the
case.</p>

<p>We are, I think, sufficiently assured, that not only
tons, but scores or hundreds of tons descend in one
spout. Scores of tons more than can be contained in
the trunk of it, should we suppose water to ascend.</p>

<p>But, after all, it does not appear that the above-mentioned
different degrees of heat and cold concur in any
region where spouts usually happen, nor, indeed, in any
other.</p>

in Connecticut.</em></a></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, Nov. 4, 1756.</p>

<p>"Air and water mutually attract each other, (saith
Mr. F.) hence water will dissolve in air, as salt in water."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I think that he hath demonstrated, that the supporting
of salt in water is not owing to its superficies
being increased, because "the specific gravity of salt
is not altered by dividing of it, any more than that of
lead, sixteen bullets of which, of an ounce each, weigh
as much in water as one of a pound." But yet, when
this came to be applied to the supporting of water in
air, I found an objection rising in my mind.</p>

<p>In the first place, I have always been loth to seek for
any new hypothesis, or particular law of nature, to account
for any thing that may be accounted for from the
known, general, and universal law of nature; it being
an argument of the infinite wisdom of the author of the
world, to effect so many things by one general law.
Now I had thought that the rising and support of water
in air, might be accounted for from the general law
of gravitation, by only supposing the spaces occupied
by the same quantity of water increased.</p>

<p>And, with respect to the lead, I queried thus in my
own mind; whether if the superficies of a bullet of lead
should be increased four or five fold by an internal vacuity,
it would weigh the same in water as before. I
mean, if a pound of lead should be formed into a hollow
globe, empty within, whose superficies should be four
or five times as big as that of the same lead when a
solid lump, it would weigh as much in water as before.
I supposed it would not. If this concavity was filled
with water, perhaps it might; if with air, it would
weigh at least as much less, as this difference between
the weight of that included air, and that of water.</p>

<p>Now although this would do nothing to account for
the dissolution of salt in water, the smallest lumps of
salt being no more hollow spheres, or any thing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like nature than the greatest; yet, perhaps, it might account
for water's rising and being supported in air.
For you know that such hollow globules, or bubbles,
abound upon the surface of the water, which even by
the breath of our mouths, we can cause to quit the
water, and rise in the air.</p>

<p>These bubbles I used to suppose to be coats of water,
containing within them air rarefied and expanded with
fire, and that, therefore, the more friction and dashing
there is upon the surface of the waters, and the more
heat and fire, the more they abound.</p>

<p>And I used to think, that although water be specifically
heavier than air, yet such a bubble, filled only
with fire and very rarefied air, may be lighter than a
quantity of common air, of the same cubical dimensions,
and, therefore, ascend; for the rarefied air inclosed,
may more fall short of the same bulk of common
air, in weight, than the watery coat exceeds a like bulk
of common air in gravity.</p>

<p>This was the objection in my mind, though, I must
confess, I know not how to account for the watery coat's
encompassing the air, as above-mentioned, without allowing
the attraction between air and water, which the
gentleman supposes; so that I do not know but that this
objection, examined by that sagacious genius, will be an
additional confirmation of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>The gentleman observes, "that a certain quantity of
moisture should be every moment discharged and taken
away from the lungs; and hence accounts for the suffocating
nature of snuffs of candles, as impregnating the
air with grease, between which and water there is a natural
repellency; and of air that hath been frequently
breathed in, which is overloaded with water, and, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that reason, can take no more air. Perhaps the same
observation will account for the suffocating nature of
damps in wells."</p>

<p>But then if the air can support and take off but such
a proportion of water, and it is necessary that water be
so taken off from the lungs, I queried with myself how
it is we can breathe in an air full of vapours, so full as
that they continually precipitated. Do not we see the
air overloaded, and casting forth water plentifully when
there is no suffocation?</p>

<p>The gentleman again observes, "That the air under
the equator, and between the tropics, being constantly
heated and rarefied by the sun, rises; its place is supplied
by air from northern and southern latitudes, which,
coming from parts where the air and earth had less
motion, and not suddenly acquiring the quicker motion
of the equatorial earth, appears an east wind blowing
westward; the earth moving from west to east, and
slipping under the air."</p>

<p>In reading this, two objections occurred to my
mind:</p>

<p>First, that it is said, the trade-wind doth not blow in
the forenoon, but only in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Secondly, that either the motion of the northern
and southern air towards the equator is so slow, as to
acquire almost the same motion as the equatorial air
when it arrives there, so that there will be no sensible
difference; or else the motion of the northern and
southern air towards the equator, is quicker, and must
be sensible; and then the trade-wind must appear either
as a south-east or north-east wind: south of the equator,
a south-east wind; north of the equator, a north-east.
For the apparent wind must be compounded of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this motion from north to south, or <em>vice versa</em>; and of
the difference between its motion from west to east,
and that of the equatorial air.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Observations in Answer to the foregoing, by B. Franklin.</em></a></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, Nov. 4, 1756.</p>

<p>1st. The supposing a mutual attraction between the
particles of water and air is not introducing a new law
of nature; such attractions taking place in many other
known instances.</p>

<p>2dly. Water is specifically 850 times heavier than
air. To render a bubble of water, then, specifically
lighter than air, it seems to me that it must take up
more than 850 times the space it did before it formed
the bubble; and within the bubble should be either a
vacuum or air rarefied more than 850 times. If a vacuum,
would not the bubble be immediately crushed by
the weight of the atmosphere? And no heat, we know
of, will rarefy air any thing near so much; much less
the common heat of the sun, or that of friction by the
dashing on the surface of the water. Besides, water
agitated ever so violently produces no heat, as has
been found by accurate experiments.</p>

<p>3dly. A hollow sphere of lead has a firmness and
consistency in it, that a hollow sphere or bubble of
fluid unfrozen water cannot be supposed to have.
The lead may support the pressure of the water it is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'immerged'">immersed</ins>
in, but the bubble could not support the pressure
of the air, if empty within.</p>

<p>4thly. Was ever a visible bubble seen to rise in air?
I have made many, when a boy, with soap-suds and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tobacco-pipe; but they all descended when loose from
the pipe, though slowly, the air impeding their motion.
They may, indeed, be forced up by a wind from below,
but do not rise of themselves, though filled with warm
breath.</p>

<p>5thly. The objection relating to our breathing moist
air seems weighty, and must be farther considered.
The air that has been breathed has, doubtless, acquired
an addition of the perspirable matter which nature
intends to free the body from, and which would be pernicious
if retained and returned into the blood; such
air then may become unfit for respiration, as well for
that reason, as on account of its moisture. Yet I
should be glad to learn, by some accurate experiment,
whether a draft of air, two or three times inspired, and
expired, perhaps in a bladder, has, or has not, acquired
more moisture than our common air in the dampest
weather. As to the precipitation of water in the air
we breathe, perhaps it is not always a mark of that air's
being overloaded. In the region of the clouds, indeed,
the air must be overloaded if it lets fall its water in
drops, which we call rain; but those drops may fall
through a drier air near the earth; and accordingly we
find that the hygroscope sometimes shews a less degree
of moisture, during a shower, than at other times when
it does not rain at all. The dewy dampness, that settles
on the insides of our walls and wainscots, seems more
certainly to denote an air overloaded with moisture;
and yet this is no sure sign: for, after a long continued
cold season, if the air grows suddenly warm, the walls,
&amp;c. continuing longer their coldness, will, for some
time, condense the moisture of such air, till they grow
equally warm, and then they condense no more, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the air is not become drier. And, on the other hand,
after a warm season, if the air grows cold, though
moister than before, the dew is not so apt to gather
on the walls. A tankard of cold water will, in a hot
and dry summer's day, collect a dew on its outside; a
tankard of hot water will collect none in the moistest
weather.</p>

<p>6thly. It is, I think, a mistake that the trade-winds
blow only in the afternoon. They blow all day and all
night, and all the year round, except in some particular
places. The southerly sea-breezes on your coasts, indeed,
blow chiefly in the afternoon. In the very long
run from the west side of America to Guam, among the
Philippine Islands, ships seldom have occasion to hand
their sails, so equal and steady is the gale, and yet they
make it in about 60 days, which could not be if the
wind blew only in the afternoon.</p>

<p>7thly. That really is, which the gentleman justly
supposes ought to be on my hypothesis. In sailing
southward, when you first enter the trade-wind, you
find it north-east, or thereabouts, and it gradually
grows more east as you approach the line. The same
observation is made of its changing from south-east to
east gradually, as you come from the southern latitudes
to the equator.</p>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, Nov. 4, 1756.</p>

<p>That power by which the air expands itself, you
attribute to a mutual repelling power in the particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which compose the air, by which they are separated
from each other with some degree of force: now this
force, on this supposition, must not only act when the
particles are in mutual contact, but likewise when they
are at some distance from each other. How can two
bodies, whether they be great or small, act at any distance,
whether that distance be small or great, without
something intermediate on which they act? For if any
body act on another, at any distance from it, however
small that distance be, without some medium to continue
the action, it must act where it is not, which to me
seems absurd.</p>

<p>It seems to me, for the same reason, equally absurd
to give a mutual attractive power between any other
particles supposed to be at a distance from each other,
without any thing intermediate to continue their mutual
action. I can neither attract nor repel any thing
at a distance, without something between my hand and
that thing, like a string, or a stick; nor can I conceive
any mutual action without some middle thing, when
the action is continued to some distance.</p>

<p>The encrease of the surface of any body lessens its
weight, both in air, and water, or any other fluid, as
appears by the slow descent of leaf-gold in the air.</p>

<p>The observation of the different density of the upper
and lower air, from heat and cold, is good, and I do not
remember it is taken notice of by others; the consequences
also are well drawn; but as to winds, they
seem principally to arise from some other cause. Winds
generally blow from some large tracts of land, and from
mountains. Where I live, on the north side of the
mountains, we frequently have a strong southerly wind,
when they have as strong a northerly wind, or calm, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the other side of these mountains. The continual passing
of vessels on Hudson's River, through these mountains,
give frequent opportunities of observing this.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year the sea-wind (by a piercing
cold) is always more uneasy to me, accustomed to
winds which pass over a tract of land, than the north-west
wind.</p>

<p>You have received the common notion of water-spouts,
which, from my own ocular observation, I am
persuaded is a false conception. In a voyage to the
West-Indies, I had an opportunity of observing many
water-spouts. One of them passed nearer than thirty
or forty yards to the vessel I was in, which I viewed
with a good deal of attention; and though it be now
forty years since I saw it, it made so strong an impression
on me, that I very distinctly remember it. These
water-spouts were in the calm latitudes, that is, between
the trade and the variable winds, in the month
of July. That spout which passed so near us was an
inverted cone, with the <em>tip</em> or <em>apex</em> towards the sea, and
reached within about eight feet of the surface of the
sea, its basis in a large black cloud. We were entirely
becalmed. It passed slowly by the vessel. I could
plainly observe, that a violent stream of wind issued
from the spout, which made a hollow of about six feet
diameter in the surface of the water, and raised the
water in a circular uneven ring round the hollow, in
the same manner that a strong blast from a pair of bellows
would do when the pipe is placed perpendicular
to the surface of the water; and we plainly heard the
same hissing noise which such a blast of wind must
produce on the water. I am very sure there was nothing
like the sucking of water from the sea into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
spout, unless the spray, which was raised in a ring to
a small height, could be mistaken for a raising of
water. I could plainly distinguish a distance of about
eight feet between the sea and the tip of the cone, in
which nothing interrupted the sight, which must have
been, had the water been raised from the sea.</p>

<p>In the same voyage I saw several other spouts at a
greater distance, but none of them whose tip of the
cone came so near the surface of the water. In some
of them the axis of the cone was considerably inclined
from the perpendicular, but in none of them was there
the least appearance of sucking up of water. Others
of them were bent or arched. I believe that a stream
of wind issued from all of them, and it is from this
stream of wind that vessels are often overset, or founder
at sea suddenly. I have heard of vessels being
overset when it was perfectly calm, the instant before
the stream of wind struck them, and immediately after
they were overset; which could not otherwise be but
by such a stream of wind from a cloud.</p>

<p>That wind is generated in clouds will not admit of
a dispute. Now if such wind be generated within the
body of the cloud, and issue in one particular place,
while it finds no passage in the other parts of the cloud,
I think it may not be difficult to account for all the appearances
in water-spouts; and from hence the reason
of breaking those spouts, by firing a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'canon-ball'">cannon-ball</ins> through
them, as thereby a horizontal vent is given to the
wind. When the wind is spent, which dilated the
cloud, or the fermentation ceases, which generates the
air and wind, the clouds may descend in a prodigious
fall of water or rain. A remarkable intestine motion,

cloud from whence the spout issues. No salt-water, I
am persuaded, was ever observed to fall from the
clouds, which must certainly have happened if sea-water
had been raised by a spout.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Answer to the foregoing Observations, by B. Franklin.</em></a></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, <span class="smcap">Nov</span>. 4, 1756.</p>

<p>I agree with you, that it seems absurd to suppose
that a body can act where it is not. I have no idea of
bodies at a distance attracting or repelling one another
without the assistance of some medium, though I know
not what that medium is, or how it operates. When
I speak of attraction or repulsion, I make use of those
words for want of others more proper, and intend only
to express <em>effects</em> which I see, and not <em>causes</em> of which
I am ignorant. When I press a blown bladder between
my knees, and find I cannot bring its sides together,
but my knees feel a springy matter, pushing them back
to a greater distance, or repelling them, I conclude
that the air it contains is the cause. And when I operate
on the air, and find I cannot by pressure force its
particles into contact, but they still spring back against
the pressure, I conceive there must be some medium
between its particles that prevents their closing, though
I cannot tell what it is. And if I were acquainted with
that medium, and found its particles to approach and
recede from each other, according to the pressure they
suffered, I should imagine there must be some finer
medium between them, by which these operations were
performed.</p>

<p>I allow that increase of the surface of a body may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
occasion it to descend slower in air, water, or any
other fluid; but do not conceive, therefore, that it
lessens its weight. Where the increased surface is so
disposed as that in its falling a greater quantity of the
fluid it sinks in must be moved out of its way, a
greater time is required for such removal. Four
square feet of sheet-lead sinking in water <em>broadways</em>,
cannot descend near so fast as it would <em>edgeways</em>, yet
its weight in the hydrostatic balance would, I imagine,
be the same, whether suspended by the middle
or by the corner.</p>

<p>I make no doubt but that ridges of high mountains
do often interrupt, stop, reverberate, or turn the winds
that blow against them, according to the different degrees
of strength of the winds, and angles of incidence.
I suppose, too, that the cold upper parts of
mountains may condense the warmer air that comes
near them, and so by making it specifically heavier,
cause it to descend on one or both sides of the ridge
into the warmer valleys, which will seem a wind blowing
from the mountain.</p>

<p>Damp winds, though not colder by the thermometer,
give a more uneasy sensation of cold than dry ones;
because (to speak like an electrician) they <em>conduct</em> better;
that is, are better fitted to convey away the heat
from our bodies. The body cannot feel <em>without</em> itself;
our sensation of cold is not in the air <em>without</em> the body,
but in those parts of the body which have been deprived
of their heat by the air. My desk, and its lock,
are, I suppose, of the same temperament when they
have been long exposed to the same air; but now if I
lay my hand on the wood, it does not seem so cold to
me as the lock; because (as I imagine) wood is not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
good a conductor, to receive and convey away the
heat from my skin, and the adjacent flesh, as metal is.
Take a piece of wood, of the size and shape of a dollar,
between the thumb and finger of one hand, and a
dollar, in like manner, with the other hand; place the
edges of both, at the same time, in the flame of a candle;
and though the edge of the wooden piece takes
flame, and the metal piece does not, yet you will be
obliged to drop the latter before the former, it conducting
the heat more suddenly to your fingers. Thus
we can, without pain, handle glass and china cups filled
with hot liquors, as tea, &amp;c. but not silver ones. A
silver tea-pot must have a wooden handle. Perhaps it
is for the same reason that woollen garments keep the
body warmer than linen ones equally thick; woollen
keeping the natural heat in, or, in other words, not
conducting it out to air.</p>

<p>In regard to water-spouts, having, in a long letter to
a gentleman of the same sentiment with you as to their
direction, said all that I have to say in support of my
opinion; I need not repeat the arguments therein contained,
as I intend to send you a copy of it by some
other opportunity, for your perusal. I imagine you
will find all the appearances you saw, accounted for by
my hypothesis. I thank you for communicating the
account of them. At present I would only say, that
the opinion of winds being generated in clouds by fermentation,
is new to me, and I am unacquainted with
the facts on which it is founded. I likewise find it difficult
to conceive of winds confined in the body of
clouds, which I imagine have little more solidity than
the fogs on the earth's surface. The objection from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the freshness of rain-water is a strong one, but I think
I have answered it in the letter above-mentioned, to
which I must beg leave, at present, to refer you.</p>

<p>[In Mr. Collinson's edition, there followed here, several

omitted, and shall content ourselves with giving the references.

<p class="right padr2"><em>April 2, 1754.</em></p>

<p>Any knowledge I have of the winds, and other
changes which happen in the atmosphere, is so very
defective, that it does not deserve the name; neither
have I received any satisfaction from the attempts of
others on this subject. It deserves then your thoughts,
as a subject in which you may distinguish yourself, and
be useful.</p>

<p>Your notion of some things conducting heat or cold
better than others pleases me, and I wish you may
pursue the scent. If I remember right, Dr. Boerhaave,
in his chymistry, thinks that heat is propagated by the
vibration of a subtle elastic fluid, dispersed through
the atmosphere and through all bodies. Sir Isaac Newton
says, there are many phenomena to prove the existence
of such a fluid; and this opinion has my assent
to it. I shall only observe that it is essentially diffe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>rent
from that which I call ether; for ether, properly
speaking, is neither a fluid nor elastic; its power consists
in re-acting any action communicated to it, with
the same force it receives the action.</p>

<p>I long to see your explication of water-spouts, but
I must tell you before-hand, that it will not be easy for
you to convince me that the principal phenomena were
not occasioned by a stream of wind issuing with great
force, my eyes and ears both concurring to give me
this sentiment, I could have no more evidence than
to feel the effects, which I had no inclination to do.</p>

<p>It surprises me a little, that wind, generated by fermentation,
is new to you, since it may be every day
observed in fermenting liquor. You know with what
force fermenting liquors will burst the vessels which
contain them, if the generated wind have not vent;
and with what force it issues on giving it a small vent,
or by drawing the cork of a bottle. Dr. Boerhaave
says, that the steam issuing from fermenting liquors received
through a very small vent-hole, into the nose,
will kill as suddenly and certainly as lightning. That
air is generated by fermentation, I think you will find
fully proved in Dr. Hales's Analysis of the Air, in his
Vegetable Statics. If you have not read the book, you
have a new pleasure to come.</p>

<p>The solution you give to the objection I made from
the contrary winds blowing from the opposite sides of
the mountains, from their being eddies, does not please
me, because the extent of these winds is by far too
large to be occasioned by any eddy. It is forty miles
from New York to our mountains, through which Hudson's
River passes. The river runs twelve miles in the
mountains, and from the north side of the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
it is about ninety miles to Albany. I have myself been
on board a vessel more than once, when we have had
a strong northerly wind against us, all the way from
New York, for two or three days. We have met vessels
from Albany, who assured us, that, on the other
side of the mountains, they had, at the same time, a
strong continued southerly wind against them; and this
frequently happens.</p>

<p>I have frequently seen, both on the river, in places
where there could be no eddy-weeds, and on the open
sea, two vessels sailing with contrary winds, within half
a mile of each other; but this happens only in easy
winds, and generally calm in other places near these
winds.</p>

<p>You have, no doubt, frequently observed a single
cloud pass, from which a violent gust of wind issues,
but of no great extent. I have observed such a gust
make a lane through the woods, of some miles in
length, by laying the trees flat to the ground, and
not above eight or ten chains in breadth. Though the
violence of the wind be in the same direction in which
the cloud moves and precedes it, yet wind issues from
all sides of it; so that supposing the cloud moves south-easterly,
those on the north-east side of it feel a south-west
wind, and others on the south-west side, a north-east.
And where the cloud passes over, we frequently
have a south-east wind from the hinder part of it, but
none violent, except the wind in the direction in which
the cloud moves. To shew what it is which prevents
the wind from issuing out equally on all sides, is not
an easy problem to me, and I shall not attempt to solve
it; but when you shall show what it is which restrains
the electrical fluid from spreading itself into the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
surrounding it, when it rushes with great violence
through the air along, or in the conductor, for a great
extent in length, then I may hope to explain the other
problem, and remove the difficulty we have in conceiving
it.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Account of a Whirlwind at Maryland.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Aug. 25, 1755.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>As you have my former papers on whirlwinds, &amp;c. I
now send you an account of one which I had lately an
opportunity of seeing and examining myself.</p>

<p>Being in Maryland, riding with Colonel Tasker, and
some other gentlemen, to his country seat, where I and
my son were entertained by that amiable and worthy
man with great hospitality and kindness, we saw, in the
vale below us, a small whirlwind beginning in the road,
and shewing itself by the dust it raised and contained.
It appeared in the form of a sugar-loaf, spinning on its
point, moving up the hill towards us, and enlarging as
it came forward. When it passed by us, its smaller part
near the ground appeared no bigger than a common
barrel, but widening upwards, it seemed, at forty or fifty
feet high, to be twenty or thirty feet in diameter. The
rest of the company stood looking after it, but my curiosity
being stronger, I followed it, riding close by its
side, and observed its licking up, in its progress, all the
dust that was under its smaller part. As it is a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
opinion that a shot, fired through a water-spout, will
break it, I tried to break this little whirlwind, by striking
my whip frequently through it, but without any effect.
Soon after, it quitted the road and took into the
woods, growing every moment larger and stronger,
raising, instead of dust, the old dry leaves with which
the ground was thick covered, and making a great
noise with them and the branches of the trees, bending
some tall trees round in a circle swiftly and very surprisingly,
though the progressive motion of the whirl
was not so swift but that a man on foot might have
kept pace with it, but the circular motion was amazingly
rapid. By the leaves it was now filled with, I
could plainly perceive that the current of air they were
driven by moved upwards in a spiral line; and when I
saw the passing whirl continue entire, after leaving the
trunks and bodies of large trees which it had enveloped,
I no longer wondered that my whip had no effect on it
in its smaller state. I accompanied it about three
quarters of a mile, till some limbs of dead trees, broken
off by the whirl, flying about, and falling near me, made
me more apprehensive of danger; and then I stopped,
looking at the top of it as it went on, which was visible,
by means of the leaves contained in it, for a very
great height above the trees. Many of the leaves, as
they got loose from the upper and widest part, were
scattered in the wind; but so great was their height in
the air, that they appeared no bigger than flies. My
son, who was, by this time, come up with me, followed
the whirlwind till it left the woods, and crossed an old
tobacco-field, where, finding neither dust nor leaves to
take up, it gradually became invisible below as it went
away over that field. The course of the general wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
then blowing was along with us as we travelled, and the
progressive motion of the whirlwind was in a direction
nearly opposite, though it did not keep a strait line,
nor was its progressive motion uniform, it making little
sallies on either hand as it went, proceeding sometimes
faster, and sometimes slower, and seeming sometimes
for a few seconds almost stationary, then starting forwards
pretty fast again. When we rejoined the company,
they were admiring the vast height of the leaves
now brought by the common wind, over our heads.
These leaves accompanied us as we travelled, some falling
now and then round about us, and some not reaching
the ground till we had gone near three miles from
the place where we first saw the whirlwind begin. Upon
my asking Colonel Tasker if such whirlwinds were common
in Maryland, he answered pleasantly, No, not at
all common, but we got this on purpose to treat Mr.
Franklin. And a very high treat it was to,</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the North-East Storms in North America.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>May 12, 1760.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Agreeable to your request, I send you my reasons
for thinking that our north-east storms in North
America begin first, in point of time, in the south-west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
parts: that is to say, the air in Georgia, the farthest of
our colonies to the south-west, begins to move south-westerly
before the air of Carolina, which is the next
colony north-eastward; the air of Carolina has the
same motion before the air of Virginia, which lies still
more north-eastward; and so on north-easterly through
Pensylvania, New-York, New-England, &amp;c. quite to
Newfoundland.</p>

<p>These north-east storms are generally very violent,
continue sometimes two or three days, and often do
considerable damage in the harbours along the coast.
They are attended with thick clouds and rain.</p>

<p>What first gave me this idea, was the following circumstance.
About twenty years ago, a few more or
less, I cannot from my memory be certain, we were to
have an eclipse of the moon at Philadelphia, on a Friday
evening, about nine o'clock. I intended to observe
it, but was prevented by a north-east storm, which came
on about seven, with thick clouds as usual, that quite
obscured the whole hemisphere. Yet when the post
brought us the Boston news-paper, giving an account
of the effects of the same storm in those parts, I found
the beginning of the eclipse had been well observed
there, though Boston lies N. E. of Philadelphia about
four hundred miles. This puzzled me, because the
storm began with us so soon as to prevent any observation,
and being a north-east storm, I imagined it must
have begun rather sooner in places farther to the north-east-ward
than it did at Philadelphia. I therefore mentioned
it in a letter to my brother, who lived at Boston;
and he informed me the storm did not begin with them
till near eleven o'clock, so that they had a good observation
of the eclipse: and upon comparing all the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
accounts I received from the several colonies, of the
time of beginning of the same storm, and since that of
other storms of the same kind, I found the beginning to
be always later the farther north-eastward. I have not
my notes with me here in England, and cannot, from
memory, say the proportion of time to distance, but I
think it is about an hour to every hundred miles.</p>

<p>From thence I formed an idea of the cause of these
storms, which I would explain by a familiar instance
or two.&mdash;Suppose a long canal of water stopped at the
end by a gate. The water is quite at rest till the gate
is open, then it begins to move out through the gate;
the water next the gate is first in motion, and moves
towards the gate; the water next to that first water
moves next, and so on successively, till the water at the
head of the canal is in motion, which is last of all. In
this case all the water moves indeed towards the gate,
but the successive times of beginning motion are the
contrary way, viz. from the gate backwards to the
head of the canal. Again, suppose the air in a chamber
at rest, no current through the room till you make
a fire in the chimney. Immediately the air in the
chimney being rarefied by the fire rises; the air next
the chimney flows in to supply its place, moving towards
the chimney; and, in consequence, the rest of the air
successively, quite back to the door. Thus to produce
our north-east storms, I suppose some great heat and
rarefaction of the air in or about the Gulph of Mexico;
the air thence rising has its place supplied by the next
more northern, cooler, and therefore denser and heavier,
air; that, being in motion, is followed by the next
more northern air, &amp;c. &amp;c. in a successive current, to
which current our coast and inland ridge of mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
give the direction of north-east, as they lie N. E. and
S. W.</p>

<p>This I offer only as an hypothesis to account for this
particular fact; and perhaps, on farther examination, a
better and truer may be found. I do not suppose all
storms generated in the same manner. Our north-west
thunder-gusts in America, I know are not; but of them
I have written my opinion fully in a paper which you
have seen.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Meteorological Imaginations and Conjectures</em></a><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</h3>

<p>There seems to be a region higher in the air over
all countries, where it is always winter, where frost
exists continually, since in the midst of summer, on the
surface of the earth, ice falls often from above in the
form of hail.</p>

<p>Hailstones, of the great weight we sometimes find
them, did not probably acquire their magnitude before
they began to descend. The air, being eight hundred
times rarer than water, is unable to support it but in
the shape of vapour, a state in which its particles are
separated. As soon as they are condensed by the cold
of the upper region, so as to form a drop, that drop begins
to fall. If it freezes into a grain of ice, that ice
descends. In descending, both the drop of water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the grain of ice are augmented by particles of the vapour
they pass through in falling, and which they condense
by coldness, and attach to themselves.</p>

<p>It is possible that, in summer, much of what is rain,
when it arrives at the surface of the earth, might have
been snow when it began its descent; but being thawed,
in passing through the warm air near the surface, it is
changed from snow into rain.</p>

<p>How immensely cold must be the original particle of
hail, which forms the centre of the future hailstone,
since it is capable of communicating sufficient cold, if
I may so speak, to freeze all the mass of vapour condensed
round it, and form a lump of perhaps six or
eight ounces in weight!</p>

<p>When, in summer time, the sun is high, and continues
long every day above the horizon, his rays strike
the earth more directly, and with longer continuance,
than in the winter; hence the surface is more heated,
and to a greater depth, by the effect of those rays.</p>

<p>When rain falls on the heated earth, and soaks down
into it, it carries down with it a great part of the heat,
which by that means descends still deeper.</p>

<p>The mass of earth, to the depth perhaps of thirty
feet, being thus heated to a certain degree, continues to
retain its heat for some time. Thus the first snows that
fall in the beginning of winter, seldom lie long on the
surface, but are soon melted, and soon absorbed. After
which, the winds, that blow over the country on which
the snows had fallen, are not rendered so cold as they
would have been, by those snows, if they had remained,
and thus the approach of the severity of winter is retarded;
and the extreme degree of its cold is not always
at the time we might expect it, viz. when the sun is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
its greatest distance, and the day shortest, but some
time after that period, according to the English proverb,
which says, "as the day lengthens, the cold strengthens;"
the causes of refrigeration continuing to operate, while
the sun returns too slowly, and his force continues too
weak to counteract them.</p>

<p>During several of the summer months of the year
1783, when the effects of the sun's rays to heat the
earth in these northern regions should have been the
greatest, there existed a constant fog over all Europe,
and great part of North America. This fog was of a
permanent nature: it was dry, and the rays of the sun
seemed to have little effect towards dissipating it, as
they easily do a moist fog, arising from water. They
were indeed rendered so faint in passing through it,
that when collected in the focus of a burning glass,
they would scarce kindle brown paper. Of course, their
summer effect in heating the earth was exceedingly
diminished.</p>

<p>Hence the surface was early frozen.</p>

<p>Hence the first snows remained on it unmelted, and
received continual additions.</p>

<p>Hence perhaps the winter of 1783-4, was more severe
than any that had happened for many years.</p>

<p>The cause of this universal fog is not yet ascertained.
Whether it was adventitious to this earth, and merely
a smoke proceeding from the consumption by fire of
some of those great burning balls or globes which we
happen to meet with in our rapid course round the sun,
and which are sometimes seen to kindle and be destroyed
in passing our atmosphere, and whose smoke
might be attracted and retained by our earth; or whether
it was the vast quantity of smoke, long continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to issue during the summer from Hecla, in Iceland,
and that other volcano which arose out of the sea near
that island, which smoke might be spread by various
winds, over the northern part of the world, is yet uncertain.</p>

<p>It seems however worth the enquiry, whether other
hard winters, recorded in history, were preceded by similar
permanent and widely extended summer fogs.
Because, if found to be so, men might from such fogs
conjecture the probability of a succeeding hard winter,
and of the damage to be expected by the breaking up
of frozen rivers in the spring; and take such measures
as are possible and practicable, to secure themselves and
effects from the mischiefs that attended the last.</p>

<p>1. Air heated by any means, becomes rarefied, and
specifically lighter than other air in the same situation
not heated.</p>

<p>2. Air being made thus lighter rises, and the neighbouring
cooler heavier air takes its place.</p>

<p>3. If in the middle of a room you heat the air by a
stove, or pot of burning coals near the floor, the heated
air will rise to the ceiling, spread over the cooler air
till it comes to the cold walls; there, being condensed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>and made heavier, it descends to supply the place of
that cool air, which had moved towards the stove or
fire, in order to supply the place of the heated air,
which had ascended from the space around the stove
or fire.</p>

<p>4. Thus there will be a continual circulation of air
in the room; which may be rendered visible by making
a little smoke, for that smoke will rise and circulate
with the air.</p>

<p>5. A similar operation is performed by nature on the
air of this globe. Our atmosphere is of a certain
height, perhaps at a medium [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] miles: above
that height it is so rare as to be almost a vacuum. The
air heated between the tropics is continually rising; its
place is supplied by northerly and southerly winds,
which come from the cooler regions.</p>

<p>6. The light heated air, floating above the cooler and
denser, must spread northward and southward; and
descend near the two poles, to supply the place of the
cool air, which had moved towards the equator.</p>

<p>7. Thus a circulation of air is kept up in our atmosphere,
as in the room above-mentioned.</p>

<p>8. That heavier and lighter air may move in currents
of different and even opposite direction, appears sometimes
by the clouds that happen to be in those currents,
as plainly as by the smoke in the experiment above-mentioned.
Also in opening a <em>door</em> between two chambers,
one of which has been warmed, by holding a candle
near the top, near the bottom, and near the middle,
you will find a strong current of warm air passing out
of the warmed room above, and another of cool air entering
below; while in the middle there is little or no
motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>9. The great quantity of vapour rising between the
tropics forms clouds, which contain much electricity.</p>

<p>Some of them fall in rain, before they come to the
polar regions.</p>

<p>10. If the rain be received in an isolated vessel, the
vessel will be electrified; for every drop brings down
some electricity with it.</p>

<p>11. The same is done by snow or hail.</p>

<p>12. The electricity so descending, in temperate climates,
is received and imbibed by the earth.</p>

<p>13. If the clouds are not sufficiently discharged by
this gradual operation, they sometimes discharge themselves
suddenly by striking into the earth, where the
earth is fit to receive their electricity.</p>

<p>14. The earth in temperate and warm climates is generally
fit to receive it, being a good conductor.</p>

<p>15. A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies
good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct.</p>

<p>16. Thus wax rendered fluid, and glass softened by
heat, will both of them conduct.</p>

<p>17. And water, though naturally a good conductor,
will not conduct well, when frozen into ice by a common
degree of cold; not at all, where the cold is
extreme.</p>

<p>18. Snow falling upon frozen ground has been found
to retain its electricity; and to communicate it to an
isolated body, when after falling, it has been driven
about by the wind.</p>

<p>19. The humidity, contained in all the equatorial
clouds that reach the polar regions, must there be condensed
and fall in snow.</p>

<p>20. The great cake of ice that eternally covers those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
regions may be too hard frozen to permit the electricity,
descending with that snow, to enter the earth.</p>

<p>21. It may therefore be <em>accumulated upon that ice</em>.</p>

<p>22. The atmosphere being heavier in the polar regions
than in the equatorial, will there be lower; as well
from that cause, as from the smaller effect of the centrifugal
force: consequently the distance of the vacuum
above the atmosphere will be less at the poles, than
elsewhere; and probably much less than the distance
(upon the surface of the globe) extending from the pole
to those latitudes in which the earth is so thawed as to
receive and imbibe electricity; (the frost continuing to
lat. 80, which is ten degrees, or six hundred miles from
the pole; while the height of the atmosphere there of
such density as to obstruct the motion of the electric
fluid, can scarce be esteemed above [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] miles).</p>

<p>23. The <em>vacuum</em> above is a good conductor.</p>

<p>24. May not then the great quantity of electricity,
brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which
are condensed there, and fall in snow, which electricity
would enter the, earth, but cannot penetrate the ice;
may it not, I say, (<em>as a bottle overcharged</em>) break through
that low atmosphere, and run along in the vacuum over
the air towards the equator; diverging as the degrees
of longitude enlarge; strongly visible where densest,
and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it
finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates,
or is mingled with their upper air?</p>

<p>25. If such an operation of nature were really performed,
would it not give all the appearances of an
aurora borealis?</p>

<p>26. And would not the auroras become more fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>quent
<em>after the approach of winter</em>: not only because
more visible in longer nights; but also because in summer
the long presence of the sun may soften the surface
of the great ice cake, and render it a conductor, by
which the accumulation of electricity in the polar regions
will be prevented?</p>

<p>27. The <em>atmosphere of the polar regions</em> being made
more dense by the extreme cold, and all the moisture in
that air being frozen; may not any great light arising
therein, and passing, through it, render its density in
some degree visible, during the night time, to those
who live in the rarer air of more southern latitudes;
and would it not in that case, although in itself a complete
and full circle, extending perhaps ten degrees
from the pole, appear to spectators so placed (who
could see only a part of it) <em>in the form of a segment</em>; its
chord resting on the horizon, and its arch elevated more
or less above it as seen from latitudes more or less distant;
<em>darkish in colour</em>, but yet <em>sufficiently transparent</em> to
permit some stars to be seen through it.</p>

<p>28. The <em>rays</em> of electric matter issuing out of a body,
diverge by mutually repelling each other, unless there
be some conducting body near, to receive them: and
if that conducting body be at a greater distance, they
will <em>first diverge</em>, and then <em>converge</em> in order to enter it.
May not this account for some of the varieties of figure
seen at times in the <em>motions</em> of the luminous matter of
the auroras: since it is possible, that in passing over
the atmosphere, from the north in all directions or meridians,
towards the equator, the rays of that matter
may find, in many places, portions of cloudy region, or
moist atmosphere under them, which (being in the natural
or negative state) may be fit to receive them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
towards which they may therefore converge: and when
one of those receiving bodies is more than saturated,
they may <em>again</em> diverge from it, towards other surrounding
masses of such humid atmosphere, and thus form
the <em>crowns</em>, as they are called, and other figures mentioned
in the histories of this meteor?</p>

<p>29. If it be true that the clouds which go to the
polar regions, and carry thither the vapours of the
equatorial and temperate regions, [have their] vapours
condensed by the extreme cold of the polar regions,
and fall in snow or hail; the winds which come from
those regions ought to be generally dry, unless they
gain some humidity by sweeping the ocean in their
way. And if I mistake not, the winds between the
north east and the north west, are for the most part
dry, when they have continued for some time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[In the Philosophical Transactions for 1774, p. 122,
is a letter from Mr. I. S. Winn to Dr. Franklin, stating,
that since he had first made the observation concerning
the south or south west winds succeeding an aurora,
he had found it invariably obtaining in twenty-three instances;
and he adds in a note a fresh confirming
instance. In reply, Dr. Franklin makes the following
conjecture.]</p>

<p>The <em>Auroræ Boreales</em>, though visible almost every
night of clear weather in the more northern regions
and very high in the atmosphere, can scarce be visible
in England, but when the atmosphere is pretty clear of
clouds for the whole space between us and those regions;
and therefore are seldom visible here. This extensive
clearness may have been produced by a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
continuance of northerly winds. When the winds have
long continued in one quarter, the return is often violent.
Allowing the fact so repeatedly observed by Mr.
Winn, perhaps this may account for the violence of the
southerly winds, that soon follow the appearance of the
aurora on our coasts.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On Cold produced by Evaporation.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>New-York, April</em> 14, 1757.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>It is a long time since I had the pleasure of a line
from you; and, indeed, the troubles of our country,
with the hurry of business I have been engaged in on
that account, have made me so bad a correspondent,
that I ought not to expect punctuality in others.</p>

<p>But being about to embark for England, I could not
quit the continent without paying my respects to you,
and, at the same time, taking leave to introduce to your
acquaintance a gentleman of learning and merit, colonel
Henry Bouquet, who does me the favour to present
you this letter, and with whom I am sure you will be
much pleased.</p>

<p>Professor Simpson, of Glasgow, lately communicated
to me some curious experiments of a physician of his
acquaintance, by which it appeared, that an extraordinary
degree of cold, even to freezing, might be produced
by evaporation. I have not had leisure to repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and examine more than the first and easiest of them,
<em>viz.</em>&mdash;Wet the ball of a thermometer by a feather dipt
in spirit of wine, which has been kept in the same
room, and has, of course, the same degree of heat or
cold. The mercury sinks presently three or four degrees,
and the quicker, if, during the evaporation, you
blow on the ball with bellows; a second wetting and
blowing, when the mercury is down, carries it yet lower.
I think I did not get it lower than five or six degrees
from where it naturally stood, which was, at that time,
sixty. But it is said, that a vessel of water being placed
in another somewhat larger, containing spirit, in such a
manner that the vessel of water is surrounded with the
spirit, and both placed under the receiver of an air-pump;
on exhausting the air, the spirit, evaporating,
leaves such a degree of cold as to freeze the water,
though the thermometer, in the open air, stands many
degrees above the freezing point.</p>

<p>I know not how this phenomenon is to be accounted
for, but it gives me occasion to mention some loose notions
relating to heat and cold, which I have for some
time entertained, but not yet reduced into any form.
Allowing common fire, as well as electrical, to be a fluid
capable of permeating other bodies, and seeking an
equilibrium, I imagine some bodies are better fitted by
nature to be conductors of that fluid than others; and
that, generally, those which are the best conductors of
the electrical fluid, are also the best conductors of this;
and <em>e contra</em>.</p>

<p>Thus a body which is a good conductor of fire readily
receives it into its substance, and conducts it
through the whole to all the parts, as metals and water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
do; and if two bodies, both good conductors, one heated,
the other in its common state, are brought into
contact with each other, the body which has most fire
readily communicates of it to that which had least, and
that which had least readily receives it, till an equilibrium
is produced. Thus, if you take a dollar between
your fingers with one hand, and a piece of wood, of the
same dimensions, with the other, and bring both at the
same time to the flame of a candle, you will find yourself
obliged to drop the dollar before you drop the
wood, because it conducts the heat of the candle sooner
to your flesh. Thus, if a silver tea-pot had a handle of
the same metal, it would conduct the heat from the
water to the hand, and become too hot to be used; we
therefore give to a metal tea-pot a handle of wood,
which is not so good a conductor as metal. But a
china or stone tea-pot being in some degree of the nature
of glass, which is not a good conductor of heat,
may have a handle of the same stuff. Thus, also, a
damp moist air shall make a man more sensible of cold,
or chill him more, than a dry air that is colder, because
a moist air is fitter to receive and conduct away the
heat of his body. This fluid, entering bodies in great
quantity, first expands them, by separating their parts a
little, afterwards, by farther separating their parts, it
renders solids fluid, and at length dissipates their parts
in air. Take this fluid from melted lead, or from water,
the parts cohere again, the first grows solid, the latter
becomes ice: and this is sooner done by the means of
good conductors.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i078.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Thus, if you take, as I have done, a
square bar of lead, four inches long, and one inch thick,
together with three pieces of wood planed to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dimensions, and lay them, as in
the margin, on a smooth board,
fixt so as not to be easily separated
or moved, and pour into the
cavity they form, as much melted
lead as will fill it, you will see
the melted lead chill, and become
firm, on the side next the leaden
bar, some time before it chills on the other three sides in
contact with the wooden bars, though before the lead was
poured in, they might all be supposed to have the same
degree of heat or coldness, as they had been exposed in
the same room to the same air. You will likewise observe,
that the leaden bar, as it has cooled the melted lead more
than the wooden bars have done, so it is itself more
heated by the melted lead. There is a certain quantity
of this fluid called fire, in every living human body,
which fluid, being in due proportion, keeps the parts of
the flesh and blood at such a just distance from each
other, as that the flesh and nerves are supple, and the
blood fit for circulation. If part of this due proportion
of fire be conducted away, by means of a contact with
other bodies, as air, water, or metals, the parts of our
skin and flesh that come into such contact first draw
more near together than is agreeable, and give that sensation
which we call cold; and if too much be conveyed
away, the body stiffens, the blood ceases to flow,
and death ensues. On the other hand, if too much of
this fluid be communicated to the flesh, the parts are
separated too far, and pain ensues, as when they are separated
by a pin or lancet. The sensation that the separation
by fire occasions, we call heat, or burning. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
desk on which I now write, and the lock of my desk,
are both exposed to the same temperature of the air,
and have therefore the same degree of heat or cold;
yet if I lay my hand successively on the wood and on
the metal, the latter feels much the coldest, not that it
is really so, but being a better conductor, it more readily
than the wood takes away and draws into itself the
fire that was in my skin. Accordingly if I lay one
hand, part on the lock, and part on the wood, and after
it had lain so some time, I feel both parts with my other
hand, I find the part that has been in contact with the
lock, very sensibly colder to the touch, than the part
that lay on the wood. How a living animal obtains its
quantity of this fluid called fire, is a curious question.
I have shown, that some bodies (as metals) have a power
of attracting it stronger than others; and I have sometimes
suspected, that a living body had some power of
attracting out of the air, or other bodies, the heat it
wanted. Thus metals hammered, or repeatedly bent,
grow hot in the bent or hammered part. But when I
consider that air, in contact with the body, cools it;
that the surrounding air is rather heated by its contact
with the body; that every breath of cooler air drawn in,
carries off part of the body's heat when it passes out
again; that therefore there must be in the body a fund
for producing it, or otherwise the animal would soon
grow cold; I have been rather inclined to think, that
the fluid <em>fire</em>, as well as the fluid <em>air</em>, is attracted by
plants in their growth, and becomes consolidated with
the other materials of which they are formed, and
makes a great part of their substance: that when they
come to be digested, and to suffer in the vessels a kind
of fermentation, part of the fire, as well as part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
air, recovers its fluid active state again, and diffuses
itself in the body digesting and separating it: that the
fire so reproduced, by digestion and separation continually
leaving the body, its place is supplied by fresh
quantities, arising from the continual separation. That
whatever quickens the motion of the fluids in an animal
quickens the separation, and reproduces more of
the fire; as exercise. That all the fire emitted by
wood, and other combustibles, when burning, existed
in them before, in a solid state, being only discovered
when separating. That some fossils, as sulphur, sea-coal,
&amp;c. contain a great deal of solid fire; and that,
in short, what escapes and is dissipated in the burning
of bodies, besides water and earth, is generally the air
and fire that before made parts of the solid. Thus I
imagine that animal heat arises by or from a kind of fermentation
in the juices of the body, in the same manner
as heat arises in the liquors preparing for distillation,
wherein there is a separation of the spirituous,
from the watry and earthy parts. And it is remarkable,
that the liquor in a distiller's vat, when in its
highest and best state of fermentation, as I have been
informed, has the same degree of heat with the human
body; that is, about 94 or 96.</p>

<p>Thus, as by a constant supply of fuel in a chimney,
you keep a warm room, so, by a constant supply of
food in the stomach, you keep a warm body; only
where little exercise is used, the heat may possibly be
conducted away too fast; in which case such materials
are to be used for cloathing and bedding, against the
effects of an immediate contact of the air, as are, in
themselves, bad conductors of heat, and, consequently,
prevent its being communicated through their substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to the air. Hence what is called <em>warmth</em> in wool, and
its preference on that account, to linen; wool not
being so good a conductor: and hence all the natural
coverings of animals, to keep them warm, are such as
retain and confine the natural heat in the body, by
being bad conductors, such as wool, hair, feathers, and
the silk by which the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sik-worm'">silk-worm</ins>, in its tender embrio
state, is first cloathed. Cloathing, thus considered,
does not make a man warm by <em>giving</em> warmth, but by
<em>preventing</em> the too quick dissipation of the heat produced
in his body, and so occasioning an accumulation.</p>

<p>There is another curious question I will just venture
to touch upon, viz. Whence arises the sudden extraordinary
degree of cold, perceptible on mixing some
chemical liquors, and even on mixing salt and snow,
where the composition appears colder than the coldest
of the ingredients? I have never seen the chemical
mixtures made, but salt and snow I have often mixed
myself, and am fully satisfied that the composition feels
much colder to the touch, and lowers the mercury in
the thermometer more than either ingredient would do
separately. I suppose, with others, that cold is nothing
more than the absence of heat or fire. Now if
the quantity of fire before contained or diffused in the
snow and salt was expelled in the uniting of the two
matters, it must be driven away either through the air
or the vessel containing them. If it is driven off thro'
the air, it must warm the air, and a thermometer held
over the mixture, without touching it, would discover
the heat, by the rising of the mercury, as it must, and
always does in warm air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>This, indeed, I have not tried, but I should guess it
would rather be driven off through the vessel, especially
if the vessel be metal, as being a better conductor
than air; and so one should find the bason warmer
after such mixture. But, on the contrary, the vessel
grows cold, and even water, in which the vessel is sometimes
placed for the experiment, freezes into hard ice
on the bason. Now I know not how to account for
this, otherwise than by supposing, that the composition
is a better conductor of fire than the ingredients separately,
and, like the lock compared with the wood, has
a stronger power of attracting fire, and does accordingly
attract it suddenly from the fingers, or a thermometer
put into it, from the bason that contains it, and
from the water in contact with the outside of the bason;
so that the fingers have the sensation of extreme
cold, by being deprived of much of their natural fire;
the thermometer sinks, by having part of its fire drawn
out of the mercury; the bason grows colder to the
touch, as, by having its fire drawn into the mixture, it
is become more capable of drawing and receiving it
from the hand; and through the bason, the water loses
its fire that kept it fluid; so it becomes ice. One would
expect, that from all this attracted acquisition of fire
to the composition, it should become warmer; and, in
fact, the snow and salt dissolve at the same time into
water, without freezing.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS">TO THE SAME ON THE SAME SUBJECT.</a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, June 17, 1758.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>In a former letter I mentioned the experiment for
cooling bodies by evaporation, and that I had, by repeatedly
wetting the thermometer with common spirits,
brought the mercury down five or six degrees.
Being lately at Cambridge, and mentioning this in conversation
with Dr. Hadley, professor of chemistry there,
he proposed repeating the experiments with ether, instead
of common spirits, as the ether is much quicker
in evaporation. We accordingly went to his chamber,
where he had both ether and a thermometer. By dipping
first the ball of the thermometer into the ether, it
appeared that the ether was precisely of the same temperament
with the thermometer, which stood then at
65; for it made no alteration in the height of the little
column of mercury. But when the thermometer
was taken out of the ether, and the ether, with which
the ball was wet, began to evaporate, the mercury sunk
several degrees. The wetting was then repeated by a
feather that had been dipped into the ether, when the
mercury sunk still lower. We continued this operation,
one of us wetting the ball, and another of the
company blowing on it with the bellows, to quicken
the evaporation, the mercury sinking all the time, till
it came down to 7, which is 25 degrees below the freezing
point, when we left off. Soon after it passed the
freezing point, a thin coat of ice began to cover the
ball. Whether this was water collected and condensed
by the coldness of the ball, from the moisture in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
air, or from our breath; or whether the feather, when
dipped into the ether, might not sometimes go through
it, and bring up some of the water that was under it,
I am not certain; perhaps all might contribute. The
ice continued increasing till we ended the experiment,
when it appeared near a quarter of an inch thick all
over the ball, with a number of small spicula, pointing
outwards. From this experiment one may see the possibility
of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's
day, if he were to stand in a passage through which
the wind blew briskly, and to be wet frequently with
ether, a spirit that is more inflammable than brandy,
or common spirits of wine.</p>

<p>It is but within these few years, that the European
philosophers seem to have known this power in nature,
of cooling bodies by evaporation. But in the east they
have long been acquainted with it. A friend tells me,
there is a passage in Bernier's Travels through Indostan,
written near one hundred years ago, that mentions
it as a practice (in travelling over dry <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'desarts'">deserts</ins> in that
hot climate) to carry water in flasks wrapt in wet woollen
cloths, and hung on the shady side of the camel,
or carriage, but in the free air; whereby, as the
cloths gradually grow drier, the water contained in
the flasks is made cool. They have likewise a kind of
earthen pots, unglazed, which let the water gradually
and slowly ooze through their pores, so as to keep the
outside a little wet, notwithstanding the continual evaporation,
which gives great coldness to the vessel, and
the water contained in it. Even our common sailors
seem to have had some notion of this property; for I
remember, that being at sea, when I was a youth, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
observed one of the sailors, during a calm in the night,
often wetting his finger in his mouth, and then holding
it up in the air, to discover, as he said, if the air had
any motion, and from which side it came; and this he
expected to do, by finding one side of his finger grow
suddenly cold, and from that side he should look for
the next wind; which I then laughed at as a fancy.</p>

<p>May not several phenomena, hitherto unconsidered,
or unaccounted for, be explained by this property?
During the hot Sunday at Philadelphia, in June 1750,
when the thermometer was up at 100 in the shade, I
sat in my chamber without exercise, only reading or
writing, with no other cloaths on than a shirt, and a
pair of long linen drawers, the windows all open, and
a brisk wind blowing through the house, the sweat ran
off the backs of my hands, and my shirt was often so
wet, as to induce me to call for dry ones to put on; in
this situation, one might have expected, that the natural
heat of the body 96, added to the heat of the air
100, should jointly have created or produced a much
greater degree of heat in the body; but the fact was,
that my body never grew so hot as the air that surrounded
it, or the inanimate bodies immersed in the
same air. For I remember well, that the desk, when
I laid my arm upon it; a chair, when I sat down in it;
and a dry shirt out of the drawer, when I put it on,
all felt exceeding warm to me, as if they had been
warmed before a fire. And I suppose a dead body
would have acquired the temperature of the air, though
a living one, by continual sweating, and by the evaporation
of that sweat, was kept cold. May not this be
a reason why our reapers in Pensylvania, working in
the open field, in the clear hot sun-shine common in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
our harvest-time<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, find themselves well able to go
through that labour, without being much incommoded
by the heat, while they continue to sweat, and while
they supply matter for keeping up that sweat, by drinking
frequently of a thin evaporable liquor, water mixed
with rum; but if the sweat stops, they drop, and sometimes
die suddenly, if a sweating is not again brought
on by drinking that liquor, or, as some rather chuse in
that case, a kind of hot punch, made with water, mixed
with honey, and a considerable proportion of vinegar?
May there not be in negroes a quicker evaporation
of the perspirable matter from their skins and
lungs, which, by cooling them more, enables them to
bear the sun's heat better than whites do? (if that is a
fact, as it is said to be; for the alledged necessity of
having negroes rather than whites, to work in the West-India
fields, is founded upon it) though the colour of
their skins would otherwise make them more sensible
of the sun's heat, since black cloth heats much sooner,
and more, in the sun, than white cloth. I am persuaded,
from several instances happening within my
knowledge, that they do not bear cold weather so well
as the whites; they will perish when exposed to a less
degree of it, and are more apt to have their limbs frostbitten;
and may not this be from the same cause?
Would not the earth grow much hotter under the summer-sun,
if a constant evaporation from its surface,
greater as the sun shines stronger, did not, by tending
to cool it; balance, in some degree, the warmer effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the sun's rays? Is it not owing to the constant evaporation
from the surface of every leaf, that trees,
though shone on by the sun, are always, even the
leaves themselves, cool to our sense? at least much
cooler than they would otherwise be? May it not be
owing to this, that fanning ourselves when warm, does
really cool us, though the air is itself warm that we
drive with the fan upon our faces; for the atmosphere
round, and next to our bodies, having imbibed as much
of the perspired vapour as it can well contain, receives
no more, and the evaporation is therefore checked and
retarded, till we drive away that atmosphere, and bring
drier air in its place, that will receive the vapour, and
thereby facilitate and increase the evaporation? Certain
it is, that mere blowing of air on a dry body
does not cool it, as any one may satisfy himself, by
blowing with a bellows on the dry ball of a thermometer;
the mercury will not fall; if it moves at all, it rather
rises, as being warmed by the friction of the air
on its surface? To these queries of imagination, I will
only add one practical observation; that wherever it is
thought proper to give ease, in cases of painful inflammation
in the flesh (as from burnings, or the like) by
cooling the part; linen cloths, wet with spirit, and applied
to the part inflamed, will produce the coolness required,
better than if wet with water, and will continue
it longer. For water, though cold when first applied,
will soon acquire warmth from the flesh, as it
does not evaporate fast enough; but the cloths wet with
spirit, will continue cold as long as any spirit is left to
keep up the evaporation, the parts warmed escaping as
soon as they are warmed, and carrying off the heat
with them.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Concerning the Light in Sea-Water.</em></a></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Read at the Royal Society, December 6, 1756.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>November</em> 12, 1753.</p>

<p>**** When I was at the eastward, I had an opportunity
of observing the luminous appearance of the sea
when disturbed: at the head and stern of the vessel, when
under way, it appeared very bright. The best opportunity
I had to observe it was in a boat, in company
with several gentlemen going from Portsmouth, about
three miles, to our vessel lying at the mouth of Piscataqua
River. Soon after we set off (it being in the
evening) we observed a luminous appearance, where
the oars dashed the water. Sometimes it was very
bright, and afterwards, as we rowed along, gradually
lessened, till almost imperceptible, and then re-illumined.
This we took notice of several times in the
passage. When I got on board the vessel, I ordered a
pail to be dipped up, full of sea-water, in which, on
the water's being moved, a sparkling light appeared.
I took a linen cloth, and strained some of the water
through it, and there was a like appearance on the
cloth, which soon went off; but on rubbing the cloth
with my finger, it was renewed. I then carried the
cloth to the light, but could not perceive any thing
upon it which should cause that appearance.</p>

<p>Several gentlemen were of opinion, that the separated
particles of putrid, animal, and other bodies,
floating on the surface of the sea, might cause that appearance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for putrid fish, &amp;c. they said, will cause it:
and the sea-animals which have died, and other bodies
putrified therein since the creation, might afford a sufficient
quantity of these particles to cover a considerable
portion of the surface of the sea; which particles
being differently dispersed, might account for the different
degrees of light in the appearance above-mentioned.
But this account seems liable to this obvious
objection, that as putrid fish, &amp;c. make a luminous
appearance without being moved or disturbed, it might
be expected that the supposed putrid particles on the
surface of the sea, should always appear luminous,
where there is not a greater light; and, consequently,
that the whole surface of the sea, covered with those
particles, should always, in dark nights, appear luminous,
without being disturbed. But this is not fact.</p>

<p>Among the rest, I threw out my conjecture, that the
said appearance might be caused by a great number of
little animals, floating on the surface of the sea, which,
on being disturbed, might, by expanding their finns,
or otherwise moving themselves, expose such a part of
their bodies as exhibits a luminous appearance, somewhat
in the manner of a glow-worm, or fire-fly: that
these animals may be more numerous in some places
than others; and, therefore, that the appearance above-mentioned
being fainter and stronger in different places,
might be owing to that: that certain circumstances of
weather, &amp;c. might invite them to the surface, on
which, in a calm, they might sport themselves and
glow; or in storms, being forced up, make the same
appearance.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in conceiving that the sea may
be stocked with animalcula for this purpose, as we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
all nature crowded with life. But it seems difficult to
conceive that such small portions of matter, even if
they were wholly luminous, should affect our sight;
much more so, when it is supposed that only a part of
them is luminous. But, if we consider some other appearances,
we may find the same difficulty to conceive
of them; and yet we know they take place. For instance,
the flame of a candle, which, it is said, may
be seen four miles round. The light which fills this
circle of eight miles diameter, was contained, when it
first left the candle, within a circle of half an inch diameter.
If the density of light, in these circumstances,
be as those circles to each other, that is, as the squares
of their diameters, the candle-light, when come to the
eye, will be 1027709337600 times rarer than when it
quitted the half inch circle. Now the aperture of the
eye, through which the light passes, does not exceed
one-tenth of an inch diameter, and the portion of the
lesser circle, which corresponds to this small portion of
the greater circle, must be proportionably, that is,
1027709337600 times less than one-tenth of an inch;
and yet this infinitely small point (if you will allow the
expression) affords light enough to make it visible four
miles; or, rather, affords light sufficient to affect the
sight at that distance.</p>

<p>The smallness of the animalcula is no objection then
to this conjecture; for supposing them to be ten thousand
times less than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimum visibile</i>, they may, notwithstanding,
emit light enough to affect the eyes, and
so to cause the luminous appearance aforesaid. This
conjecture I send you for want of something better ****.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Saltness of Sea-Water.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, May 7, 1760.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>**** It has, indeed, as you observe, been
the opinion of some very great naturalists, that the sea
is salt only from the dissolution of mineral or rock-salt,
which its waters happened to meet with. But this
opinion takes it for granted that all water was originally
fresh, of which we can have no proof. I own I am
inclined to a different opinion, and rather think all the
water on this globe was originally salt, and that the
fresh water we find in springs and rivers, is the produce
of distillation. The sun raises the vapours from
the sea, which form clouds, and fall in rain upon the
land, and springs and rivers are formed of that rain.
As to the rock-salt found in mines, I conceive, that instead
of communicating its saltness to the sea, it is itself
drawn from the sea, and that of course the sea is
now fresher than it was originally. This is only another
effect of nature's distillery, and might be performed
various ways.</p>

<p>It is evident from the quantities of sea-shells, and
the bones and teeth of fishes found in high lands, that
the sea has formerly covered them. Then, either the
sea has been higher than it now is, and has fallen away
from those high lands, or they have been lower than
they are, and were lifted up out of the water to their
present height, by some internal mighty force, such as
we still feel some remains of, when whole continents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
are moved by earthquakes. In either case it may be
supposed that large hollows or valleys among hills,
might be left filled with sea-water, which evaporating,
and the fluid part drying away in a course of years,
would leave the salt covering the bottom; and that
salt coming afterwards to be covered with earth,
from the neighbouring hills, could only be found by
digging through that earth. Or, as we know from
their effects, that there are deep fiery caverns under
the earth, and even under the sea, if at any time the
sea leaks into any of them, the fluid parts of the water
must evaporate from that heat, and pass off through
some volcano, while the salt remains, and by degrees,
and continual acretion, becomes a great mass. Thus
the cavern may at length be filled, and the volcano
connected with it cease burning, as many it is said
have done; and future miners, penetrating such cavern,
find what we call a salt-mine. This is a fancy I had
on visiting the salt-mines at Northwich, with my son.
I send you a piece of the rock-salt which he brought
up with him out of the mine. ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Effect of Air on the Barometer, and the Benefits derived
from the Study of Insects.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven Street, June 11, 1760.</em></p>

<p>'Tis a very sensible question you ask, how the air
can affect the barometer, when its opening appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
covered with wood? If indeed it was so closely covered
as to admit of no communication of the outward air
to the surface of the mercury, the change of weight in
the air could not possibly affect it. But the least crevice
is sufficient for the purpose; a pinhole will do the
business. And if you could look behind the frame
to which your barometer is fixed, you would certainly
find some small opening.</p>

<p>There are indeed some barometers in which the body
of mercury at the lower end is contained in a close
leather bag, and so the air cannot come into immediate
contact with the mercury; yet the same effect is produced.
For the leather being flexible, when the bag
is pressed by any additional weight of air it contracts,
and the mercury is forced up into the tube; when the
air becomes lighter, and its pressure less, the weight
of the mercury prevails, and it descends again into the
bag.</p>

<p>Your observation on what you have lately read concerning
insects is very just and solid. Superficial
minds are apt to despise those who make that part of
the creation their study, as mere triflers; but certainly
the world has been much obliged to them. Under the
care and management of man, the labours of the little
silkworm afford employment and subsistence to thousands
of families, and become an immense article of
commerce. The bee, too, yields us its delicious honey,
and its wax useful to a multitude of purposes.
Another insect, it is said, produces the cochineal, from
whence we have our rich scarlet dye. The usefulness
of the cantharides or Spanish flies, in medicine, is
known to all, and thousands owe their lives to that
knowledge. By human industry and observation, other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
properties of other insects may possibly be hereafter
discovered, and of equal utility. A thorough acquaintance
with the nature of these little creatures may also
enable mankind to prevent the increase of such as are
noxious, or secure us against the mischiefs they occasion.
These things doubtless your books make mention
of: I can only add a particular late instance which
I had from a Swedish gentleman of good credit. In the
green timber, intended for ship-building at the king's
yards in that country, a kind of worms were found,
which every year became more numerous and more
pernicious, so that the ships were greatly damaged before
they came into use. The king sent Linnæus, the
great naturalist, from Stockholm, to enquire into the
affair, and see if the mischief was capable of any remedy.
He found, on examination, that the worm was
produced from a small egg, deposited in the little roughnesses
on the surface of the wood, by a particular kind
of fly or beetle; from whence the worm, as soon as it
was hatched, began to eat into the substance of the
wood, and after some time came out again a fly of the
parent kind, and so the species increased. The season
in which the fly laid its eggs, Linnæus knew to be about
a fortnight (I think) in the month of May, and at no
other time in the year. He therefore advised, that
some days before that season, all the green timber
should be thrown into the water, and kept under water
till the season was over. Which being done by the
king's order, the flies missing their usual nests, could
not increase; and the species was either destroyed or
went elsewhere; and the wood was effectually preserved,
for after the first year, it became too dry and hard
for their purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, however, a prudent moderation to be used
in studies of this kind. The knowledge of nature may
be ornamental, and it may be useful, but if to attain an
eminence in that, we neglect the knowledge and practice
of essential duties, we deserve reprehension. For
there is no rank in natural knowledge of equal dignity
and importance with that of being a good parent, a
good child, a good husband, or wife, a good neighbour
or friend, a good subject or citizen, that is, in short, a
good christian. Nicholas Gimcrack, therefore, who
neglected the care of his family, to pursue butterflies,
was a just object of ridicule, and we must give him up
as fair game to the satyrist.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Bristol Waters, and the Tide in Rivers.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, Sept. 13, 1760.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">My dear Friend,</p>

<p>I have your agreeable letter from Bristol, which I
take this first leisure hour to answer, having for some
time been much engaged in business.</p>

<p>Your first question, <em>What is the reason the water at this
place, though cold at the spring, becomes warm by pumping?</em>
It will be most prudent in me to forbear attempting
to answer, till, by a more circumstantial account,
you assure me of the fact. I own I should expect that
operation to warm, not so much the water pumped, as
the person pumping.&mdash;The rubbing of dry solids toge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>ther
has been long observed to produce heat; but the
like effect has never yet, that I have heard, been produced
by the mere agitation of fluids, or friction of
fluids with solids. Water in a bottle shook for hours
by a mill-hopper, it is said, discovered no sensible addition
of heat. The production of animal heat by exercise
is therefore to be accounted for in another manner,
which I may hereafter endeavour to make you acquainted
with.</p>

<p>This prudence of not attempting to give reasons before
one is sure of facts, I learnt from one of your sex,
who, as Selden tells us, being in company with some
gentlemen that were viewing, and considering something
which they called a Chinese shoe, and disputing
earnestly about the manner of wearing it, and how it
could possibly be put on; put in her word, and said
modestly, <em>Gentlemen, are you sure it is a shoe?&mdash;Should
not that be settled first?</em></p>

<p>But I shall now endeavour to explain what I said to
you about the tide in rivers, and to that end shall make
a figure, which though not very like a river, may serve
to convey my meaning.&mdash;Suppose a canal one hundred
and forty miles long, communicating at one end with
the sea, and filled therefore with sea water. I chuse a
canal at first, rather than a river, to throw out of consideration
the effects produced by the streams of fresh
water from the land, the inequality in breadth, and the
crookedness of courses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i096.jpg" width="500" height="170" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Let A, C, be the head of the canal; C, D, the bottom
of it; D, F, the open mouth of it next the sea.
Let the strait pricked line, B, G, represent low water
mark the whole length of the canal, A, F, high water
mark:&mdash;Now if a person standing at E, and observing
at the time of high water there, that the canal is quite
full at that place up to the line E, should conclude that
the canal is equally full to the same height from end to
end, and therefore there was as much more water come
into the canal since it was down at low water mark, as
would be included in the oblong space A, B, G, F, he
would be greatly mistaken. For the tide is <em>a wave</em>, and
the top of the wave, which makes high water, as well as
every other lower part, is progressive; and it is high
water successively, but not at the same time, in all the
several points between G, F, and A, B.&mdash;And in such
a length as I have mentioned it is low water at F, G,
and also at A, B, at or near the same time with its
being high water at E; so that the surface of the water
in the canal, during that situation, is properly represented
by the curve pricked line B, E, G. And on the
other hand, when it is low water at E, H, it is high water
both at F, G, and at A, B, at or near the same
time: and the surface would then be described by the
inverted curve line, A, H, F.</p>

<p>In this view of the case, you will easily see, that there
must be very little more water in the canal at what we
call high water, than there is at low water, those terms
not relating to the whole canal at the same time, but
successively to its parts. And if you suppose the canal
six times as long, the case would not vary as to the
quantity of water at different times of the tide; there
would only be six waves in the canal at the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
instead of one, and the hollows in the water would be
equal to the hills.</p>

<p>That this is not mere theory, but conformable to
fact, we know by our long rivers in America. The Delaware,
on which Philadelphia stands, is in this particular
similar to the canal I have supposed of one wave:
for when it is high water at the Capes or mouth of the
river, it is also high water at Philadelphia, which stands
about one hundred and forty miles from the sea; and
there is at the same time a low water in the middle between
the two high waters; where, when it comes to be
high water, it is at the same time low water at the
Capes and at Philadelphia. And the longer rivers have
some a wave and half, some two, three, or four waves,
according to their length. In the shorter rivers of this
island, one may see the same thing in part: for instance,
it is high water at Gravesend an hour before it is high
water at London Bridge; and twenty miles below
Gravesend an hour before it is high water at Gravesend.
Therefore at the time of high water at Gravesend
the top of the wave is there, and the water is then not
so high by some feet where the top of the wave was an
hour before, or where it will be an hour after, as it is
just then at Gravesend.</p>

<p>Now we are not to suppose, that because the swell or
top of the wave runs at the rate of twenty miles an
hour, that therefore the current, or water itself of which
the wave is composed, runs at that rate. Far from it.
To conceive this motion of a wave, make a small experiment
or two. Fasten one end of a cord in a window
near the top of a house, and let the other end come
down to the ground; take this end in your hand, and
you may, by a sudden motion, occasion a wave in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
cord that will run quite up to the window; but though
the wave is progressive from your hand to the window,
the parts of the rope do not proceed with the wave,
but remain where they were, except only that kind of
motion that produces the wave. So if you throw a
stone into a pond of water when the surface is still and
smooth, you will see a circular wave proceed from the
stone as its centre, quite to the sides of the pond; but
the water does not proceed with the wave, it only rises
and falls to form it in the different parts of its course;
and the waves that follow the first, all make use of the
same water with their predecessors.</p>

<p>But a wave in water is not indeed in all circumstances
exactly like that in a cord; for water being a fluid,
and gravitating to the earth, it naturally runs from a
higher place to a lower; therefore the parts of the wave
in water do actually run a little both ways from its top
towards its lower sides, which the parts of the wave in
the cord cannot do. Thus, when it is high and
standing water at Gravesend, the water twenty miles
below has been running ebb, or towards the sea for
an hour, or ever since it was high water there;
but the water at London Bridge will run flood, or
from the sea yet another hour, till it is high water,
or the top of the wave arrives at that bridge, and
then it will have run ebb an hour at Gravesend, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Now this motion of the water, occasioned only by its
gravity, or tendency to run from a higher place to a
lower, is by no means so swift as the motion of the
wave. It scarce exceeds perhaps two miles in an
hour.</p>

<p>If it went as the wave does twenty miles an hour, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ships could ride at anchor in such a stream, nor boats
row against it.</p>

<p>In common speech, indeed, this current of the water
both ways from the top of the wave is called <em>the tide</em>;
thus we say, <em>the tide runs strong</em>, <em>the tide runs at the rate
of one, two, or three miles an hour, &amp;c.</em> and when we are
at a part of the river behind the top of the wave, and
find the water lower than high-water mark, and running
towards the sea, we say, <em>the tide runs ebb</em>; and when
we are before the top of the wave, and find the water
higher than low-water mark, and running from the sea,
we say, <em>the tide runs flood</em>; but these expressions are only
locally proper; for a tide, strictly speaking, is <em>one whole
wave</em>, including all its parts higher and lower, and these
waves succeed one another about twice in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>This motion of the water, occasioned by its gravity,
will explain to you why the water near the mouths of
rivers may be salter at high water than at low. Some
of the salt-water, as the tide wave enters the river, runs
from its top and fore side, and mixes with the fresh,
and also pushes it back up the river.</p>

<p>Supposing that the water commonly runs during the
flood at the rate of two miles in an hour, and that the
flood runs five hours, you see that it can bring at most
into our canal only a quantity of water equal to the
space included in the breadth of the canal, ten miles of
its length, and the depth between low and high-water
mark; which is but a fourteenth part of what would be
necessary to fill all the space between low and high-water
mark, for one hundred and forty miles, the whole
length of the canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>And indeed such a quantity of water as would fill that
whole space, to run in and out every tide, must create
so outrageous a current, as would do infinite damage to
the shores, shipping, &amp;c. and make the navigation of a
river almost impracticable.</p>

<p>I have made this letter longer than I intended, and
therefore reserve for another what I have further to say
on the subject of tides and rivers. I shall now only
add, that I have not been exact in the numbers, because
I would avoid perplexing you with minute calculations,
my design at present being chiefly to give you distinct
and clear ideas of the first principles.</p>

<p>After writing six folio pages of philosophy to a
young girl, is it necessary to finish such a letter with a
compliment?&mdash;Is not such a letter of itself a compliment?&mdash;Does
it not say, she has a mind thirsty after
knowledge, and capable of receiving it; and that the
most agreeable things one can write to her are those
that tend to the improvement of her understanding?&mdash;It
does indeed say all this, but then it is still no compliment;
it is no more than plain honest truth, which
is not the character of a compliment. So if I would
finish my letter in the <em>mode</em>, I should yet add some
thing that means nothing, and is <em>merely</em> civil and
polite. But being naturally aukward at every <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'circumsance'">circumstance</ins>
of ceremony, I shall not attempt it. I had rather
conclude abruptly with what pleases me more than any
compliment can please you, that I am allowed to subscribe
myself</p>

<p>Supposing the fact, that the water of the well at
Bristol is warmer after sometime pumping, I think
your manner of accounting for that increased warmth
very ingenious and probable. It did not occur to me,
and therefore I doubted of the fact.</p>

<p>You are, I think quite right in your opinion, that
the rising of the tides in rivers is not owing to the immediate
influence of the moon on the rivers. It is rather
a subsequent effect of the influence of the moon
on the sea, and does not make its appearance in some
rivers till the moon has long passed by. I have not expressed
myself clearly if you have understood me to
mean otherwise. You know I have mentioned it as a
fact, that there are in some rivers several tides all existing
at the same time; that is, two, three, or more,
high-waters, and as many low-waters, in different parts
of the same river, which cannot possibly be all effects
of the moon's immediate action on that river; but they
may be subsequent effects of her action on the sea.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Salt-Water rendered fresh by Distillation.&mdash;Method of relieving
Thirst by Sea-Water.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven-street, August 10, 1761.</em></p>

<p>We are to set out this week for Holland, where we may
possibly spend a month, but purpose to be at home
again before the coronation. I could not go without
taking leave of you by a line at least, when I am so
many letters in your debt.</p>

<p>In yours of May 19, which I have before me, you
speak of the ease with which salt water may be made
fresh by distillation, supposing it to be, as I had said,
that in evaporation the air would take up water but not
the salt that was mixed with it. It is true that distilled
sea water will not be salt, but there are other disagree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>able
qualities that rise with the water in distillation;
which indeed several besides Dr. Hales have endeavoured
by some means to prevent; but as yet their methods
have not been brought much into use.</p>

<p>I have a singular opinion on this subject, which I
will venture to communicate to you, though I doubt
you will rank it among my whims. It is certain that
the skin has <em>imbibing</em> as well as <em>discharging</em> pores; witness
the effects of a blistering plaister, &amp;c. I have read
that a man, hired by a physician to stand by way of experiment
in the open air naked during a moist night,
weighed near three pounds heavier in the morning. I
have often observed myself, that however thirsty I may
have been before going into the water to swim, I am
never long so in the water. These imbibing pores,
however, are very fine, perhaps fine enough in filtering
to separate salt from water; for though I have soaked
(by swimming, when a boy) several hours in the day for
several days successively in salt-water, I never found
my blood and juices salted by that means, so as to make
me thirsty or feel a salt taste in my mouth: and it is
remarkable, that the flesh of sea fish, though bred in
salt-water, is not salt.&mdash;Hence I imagine, that if people
at sea, distressed by thirst when their fresh water is unfortunately
spent, would make bathing-tubs of their
empty water-casks, and, filling them with sea-water,
sit in them an hour or two each day, they might be
greatly relieved. Perhaps keeping their clothes constantly
wet might have an almost equal effect; and
this without danger of catching cold. Men do not
catch cold by wet cloaths at sea. Damp, but not wet
linen may possibly give colds; but no one catches cold
by bathing, and no clothes can be wetter than water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
itself. Why damp clothes should then occasion colds,
is a curious question, the discussion of which I reserve
for a future letter, or some future conversation.</p>

<p>Adieu, my little philosopher. Present my respectful
compliments to the good ladies your aunts, and to miss
Pitt; and believe me ever</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Tendency of Rivers to the Sea.&mdash;Effect of the Sun's Rays on Cloths
of different Colours.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Sept. 20, 1761.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">My dear Friend,</p>

<p>It is, as you observed in our late conversation, a
very general opinion, that <em>all rivers run into the sea</em>, or
deposite their waters there. 'Tis a kind of audacity to
call such general opinions in question, and may subject
one to censure. But we must hazard something in
what we think the cause of truth: and if we propose
our objections modestly, we shall, though mistaken, deserve
a censure less severe, than when we are both mistaken
and insolent.</p>

<p>That some rivers run into the sea is beyond a doubt:
such, for instance, are the Amazons, and I think the
Oronoko and the Mississippi. The proof is, that their
waters are fresh quite to the sea, and out to some distance
from the land. Our question is, whether the fresh
waters of those rivers whose beds are filled with salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
water to a considerable distance up from the sea (as
the Thames, the Delaware, and the rivers that communicate
with Chesapeak-bay in Virginia) do ever arrive
at the sea? And as I suspect they do not, I am now to
acquaint you with my reasons; or, if they are not allowed
to be reasons, my conceptions at least, of this
matter.</p>

<p>The common supply of rivers is from springs, which
draw their origin from rain that has soaked into the
earth. The union of a number of springs forms a river.
The waters as they run, exposed to the sun, air, and
wind, are continually evaporating. Hence in travelling
one may often see where a river runs, by a long blueish
mist over it, though we are at such a distance as not
to see the river itself. The quantity of this evaporation
is greater or less, in proportion to the surface exposed
by the same quantity of water to those causes of
evaporation. While the river runs in a narrow confined
channel in the upper hilly country, only a small
surface is exposed; a greater as the river widens. Now
if a river ends in a lake, as some do, whereby its waters
are spread so wide as that the evaporation is equal to
the sum of all its springs, that lake will never overflow:&mdash;And
if instead of ending in a lake, it was drawn into
greater length as a river, so as to expose a surface equal
in the whole to that lake, the evaporation would be
equal, and such river would end as a canal; when the
ignorant might suppose, as they actually do in such
cases, that the river loses itself by running under ground,
whereas in truth it has run up into the air.</p>

<p>Now, many rivers that are open to the sea widen
much before they arrive at it, not merely by the additional
waters they receive, but by having their course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
stopped by the opposing flood-tide; by being turned
back twice in twenty-four hours, and by finding broader
beds in the low flat countries to dilate themselves in;
hence the evaporation of the fresh water is proportionably
increased; so that in some rivers it may equal the
springs of supply. In such cases, the salt water comes
up the river, and meets the fresh in that part where, if
there were a wall or bank of earth across from side
to side, the river would form a lake, fuller indeed at
some times than at others, according to the seasons,
but whose evaporation would, one time with another,
be equal to its supply.</p>

<p>When the communication between the two kinds of
water is open, this supposed wall of separation may be
conceived as a moveable one, which is not only pushed
some miles higher up the river by every flood tide from
the sea, and carried down again as far by every tide of
ebb, but which has even this space of vibration removed
nearer to the sea in wet seasons, when the springs and
brooks in the upper country are augmented by the falling
rains, so as to swell the river, and farther from the
sea in dry seasons.</p>

<p>Within a few miles above and below this moveable
line of separation, the different waters mix a little,
partly by their motion to and fro, and partly from the
greater specific gravity of the salt water, which inclines
it to run under the fresh, while the fresh water, being
lighter, runs over the salt.</p>

<p>Cast your eye on the map of North America, and
observe the bay of Chesapeak in Virginia, mentioned
above; you will see, communicating with it by their
mouths, the great rivers Sasquehanah, Potowmack,
Rappahanock, York, and James, besides a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
smaller streams, each as big as the Thames. It has
been proposed by philosophical writers, that to compute
how much water any river discharges into the sea
in a given time, we should measure its depth and swiftness
at any part above the tide; as, for the Thames, at
Kingston or Windsor. But can one imagine, that if
all the water of those vast rivers went to the sea, it
would not first have pushed the salt water out of that
narrow-mouthed bay, and filled it with fresh?&mdash;The
Sasquehanah alone would seem to be sufficient for this,
if it were not for the loss by evaporation. And yet
that bay is salt quite up to Annapolis.</p>

<p>As to our other subject, the different degrees of heat
imbibed from the sun's rays by cloths of different colours,
since I cannot find the notes of my experiment
to send you, I must give it as well as I can from memory.</p>

<p>But first let me mention an experiment you may
easily make yourself. Walk but a quarter of an hour
in your garden when the sun shines, with a part of your
dress white, and a part black; then apply your hand to
them alternately, and you will find a very great difference
in their warmth. The black will be quite hot to
the touch, the white still cool.</p>

<p>Another. Try to fire the paper with a burning glass.
If it is white, you will not easily burn it;&mdash;but if you
bring the focus to a black spot, or upon letters, written
or printed, the paper will immediately be on fire under
the letters.</p>

<p>Thus fullers and dyers find black cloths, of equal
thickness with white ones, and hung out equally wet,
dry in the sun much sooner than the white, being more
readily heated by the sun's rays. It is the same before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a fire; the heat of which sooner penetrates black stockings
than white ones, and so is apt sooner to burn a
man's shins. Also beer much sooner warms in a black
mug set before the fire, than in a white one, or in a
bright silver tankard.</p>

<p>My experiment was this. I took a number of little
square pieces of broad cloth from a taylor's pattern-card,
of various colours. There were black, deep blue,
lighter blue, green, purple, red, yellow, white, and other
colours, or shades of colours. I laid them all out upon
the snow in a bright sun-shiny morning. In a few
hours (I cannot now be exact as to the time) the black,
being warmed most by the sun, was sunk so low as to
be below the stroke of the sun's rays; the dark blue almost
as low, the lighter blue not quite so much as the
dark, the other colours less as they were lighter; and
the quite white remained on the surface of the snow,
not having entered it at all.</p>

<p>What signifies philosophy that does not apply to
some use?&mdash;-May we not learn from hence, that black
clothes are not so fit to wear in a hot sunny climate or
season, as white ones; because in such clothes the body
is more heated by the sun when we walk abroad, and
are at the same time heated by the exercise, which
double heat is apt to bring on putrid dangerous fevers?
That soldiers and seamen, who must march and labour
in the sun, should in the East or West Indies have an
uniform of white? That summer hats, for men or women,
should be white, as repelling that heat which gives
head-achs to many, and to some the fatal stroke that
the French call the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de soleil?</i> That the ladies summer
hats, however, should be lined with black, as not
reverberating on their faces those rays which are re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>flected
upwards from the earth or water? That the putting
a white cap of paper or linen <em>within</em> the crown of a
black hat, as some do, will not keep out the heat, though
it would if placed <em>without</em>. That fruit-walls being
blacked may receive so much heat from the sun in the
day-time, as to continue warm in some degree through
the night, and thereby preserve the fruit from frosts, or
forward its growth?&mdash;with sundry other particulars of
less or greater importance, that will occur from time to
time to attentive minds?&mdash;I am,</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Vis Inertiæ of Matter.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, 1748.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>According to my promise, I send you <em>in writing</em>
my observations on your book<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>: you will be the better
able to consider them; which I desire you to do at
your leisure, and to set me right where I am wrong.</p>

<p>I stumble at the threshold of the building, and therefore
have not read farther. The author's <em>vis inertiæ
essential to matter</em>, upon which the whole work is founded,
I have not been able to comprehend. And I do
not think he demonstrates at all clearly (at least to me
he does not) that there is really <em>such a property in
matter</em>.</p>

<p>He says, No. 2. "Let a given body or mass of matter
be called <em>a</em>, and let any given celerity be called c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
That <em>celerity</em> doubled, tripled, &amp;c. or halved, thirded,
&amp;c. will be 2 <em>c</em>, 3 <em>c</em>, &amp;c. or ½ <em>c</em>, &#8531; <em>c</em>, &amp;c. respectively: also
the <em>body</em> doubled, tripled, or halved, thirded, will be
2 <em>a</em>, 3 <em>a</em>, or ½ <em>a</em>, &#8531; <em>a</em>, respectively." Thus far is clear.&mdash;But
he adds, "Now to move the body <em>a</em> with the celerity
<em>c</em>, requires a certain force to be impressed upon it;
and to move it with a celerity as 2 <em>c</em>, requires <em>twice that
force</em> to be impressed upon it, &amp;c." Here I suspect
some mistake creeps in by the author's not distinguishing
between a great force applied at once, or a small
one continually applied, to a mass of matter, in order to
move it. I think it is generally allowed by the philosophers,
and, for aught we know, is certainly true, that
there is no mass of matter, how great soever, but may
be moved by any force how small soever (taking friction
out of the question) and this small force continued,
will in time bring the mass to move with any velocity
whatsoever.&mdash;Our author himself seems to allow this
towards the end of the same No. 2. when he is subdividing
his celerities and forces: for as in continuing the
division to eternity by his method of ½ <em>c</em>, &#8531; <em>c</em>, ¼ <em>c</em>, &#8533; <em>c</em>,
&amp;c. you can never come to a fraction of velocity that
is equal to 0 <em>c</em>, or no celerity at all; so dividing the
force in the same manner, you can never come to a
fraction of force that will not produce an equal fraction
of celerity.&mdash;Where then is the mighty vis inertiæ, and
what is its strength; when the greatest assignable mass
of matter will give way to, or be moved by the <em>least</em>
assignable force? Suppose two globes, equal to the sun
and to one another, exactly equipoised in Jove's balance;
suppose no friction in the centre of motion, in
the beam or elsewhere: if a musketo then were to light
on one of them, would he not give motion to them both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
causing one to descend and the other to rise? If it is
objected, that the force of gravity helps one globe to
descend, I answer, the same force opposes the other's
rising: here is an equality that leaves the whole motion
to be produced by the musketo, without whom those
globes would not be moved at all.&mdash;What then does
vis inertiæ do in this case? and what other effect could
we expect <em>if there were no such thing</em>? Surely if it were
any thing more than a phantom, there might be enough
of it in such <em>vast</em> bodies to annihilate, by its opposition
to motion, so trifling a force?</p>

<p>Our author would have reasoned more clearly, I
think, if, as he has used the letter <em>a</em> for a certain quantity
of matter, and <em>c</em> for a certain quantity of celerity,
he had employed one letter more, and put <em>f</em> perhaps,
for a certain quantity of force. This let us suppose to
be done; and then as it is a maxim that the force of bodies
in motion is equal to the quantity of matter multiplied
by the celerity, (or <em>f</em> = <em>c</em> X <em>a</em>); and as the force received
by and subsisting in matter, when it is put in
motion, can never exceed the force given; so if, <em>f</em> moves
<em>a</em> with <em>c</em>, there must needs be required 2 <em>f</em> to move <em>a</em> with
2 <em>c</em>; for <em>a</em> moving with 2 <em>c</em> would have a force equal to
2 <em>f</em>, which it could not receive from 1 <em>f</em>; and this, not
because there is such a thing as vis inertiæ, for the
case would be the same <em>if that had no existence</em>; but because
nothing <em>can</em> give more than it has, if 1 <em>f</em> can to
1 <em>a</em> give 1 <em>c</em>, which is the same thing as giving it 1 <em>f</em>;
(i. e. if force applied to matter at rest, can put it in motion,
and give it <em>equal</em> force) where then is vis inertiæ?
If it existed at all in matter, should we not find the
quantity of its resistance <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'substracted'">subtracted</ins> from the force
given?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In No. 4. our author goes on and says, "the body <em>a</em>
requires a certain force to be impressed on it to be moved
with a celerity as <em>c</em>, or such a force is necessary; and
therefore makes a certain resistance, &amp;c. A body as 2 <em>a</em>
requires <em>twice</em> that force to be moved with the <em>same celerity</em>,
or it makes twice that resistance; and so on."&mdash;This
I think is not true; but that the body 2 <em>a</em> moved
by the force 1 <em>f</em> (though the eye may judge otherwise of
it) does really move with the same celerity as it did
when impelled by the same force; for 2 <em>a</em> is compounded
of 1 <em>a</em>+1 <em>a</em>: and if each of the 1 <em>a</em>'s or each part of
the compound were made to move with 1 <em>c</em> (as they
might be by 2 <em>f</em>) then the whole would move with 2 <em>c</em>,
and not with 1 <em>c</em>, as our author supposes. But 1 <em>f</em> applied
to 2 <em>a</em>, makes each <em>a</em> move with ½ <em>c</em>; and so the
whole moves with 1 <em>c</em>; exactly the same as 1 <em>a</em> was
made to do by 1 <em>f</em> before. What is equal celerity but
a <em>measuring the same space by moving bodies in the same
time</em>?&mdash;Now if 1 <em>a</em> impelled by 1 <em>f</em> measures 100 yards
in a minute; and in 2 <em>a</em> impelled by 1 <em>f</em>, each <em>a</em> measures
50 yards in a minute, which added make 100; are
not the celerities as the forces equal? and since force
and celerity in the same quantity of matter are always
in <em>proportion</em> to each other, why should we, when the
quantity of matter is doubled, allow the force to continue
unimpaired, and yet suppose one half of the celerity
to be lost?&mdash;I wonder the more at our author's mistake
in this point, since in the same number I find him observing:
"We may easily conceive that a body as 3 <em>a</em>,
4 <em>a</em>, &amp;c. would make 3 or 4 bodies equal to once <em>a</em>, each
of which would require once the first force to be moved
with the celerity <em>c</em>." If then in 3 <em>a</em>, each <em>a</em> requires
once the first force <em>f</em> to be moved with the celerity <em>c</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
would not each move with the force <em>f</em> and celerity <em>c</em>;
and consequently the whole be 3 <em>a</em> moving with 3 <em>f</em>
and 3 <em>c?</em> After so distinct an observation, how could he
miss of the consequence, and imagine that 1 <em>c</em> and 3 <em>c</em>
were the same? Thus as our author's abatement of celerity
in the case of 2 <em>a</em> moved by 1 <em>f</em> is imaginary, so
must be his additional resistance.&mdash;And here again, I
am at a loss to discover any effect of the vis inertiæ.</p>

<p>In No. 6, he tells us, "that all this is likewise certain
when taken the contrary way, viz. <em>from motion to rest</em>;
for the body <em>a</em> moving with a certain velocity, as <em>c</em>, requires
a certain degree of force or resistance to stop
that motion, &amp;c. &amp;c." that is, in other words, equal
force is necessary to destroy force. It may be so. But
how does that discover a vis inertiæ? would not the
effect be the same <em>if there were no such thing</em>? A force
1 <em>f</em> strikes a body 1 <em>a</em>, and moves it with the celerity 1
<em>c</em>, i. e. with the force 1 <em>f</em>: It requires, even according to
our author, only an opposing 1 <em>f</em> to stop it. But ought
it not (if there were a vis inertiæ) to have not only the
force 1 <em>f</em>, but an additional force equal to the force of
vis inertiæ, that <em>obstinate power by which a body endeavours
with</em> all its might <em>to continue in its present state,
whether of motion or rest</em>? I say, ought there not to be
an opposing force equal to the sum of these?&mdash;The truth
however is, that there is no body, how large soever,
moving with any velocity, how great soever, but may
be stopped by any opposing force, how small soever,
continually applied. At least all our modern philosophers
agree to tell us so.</p>

<p>Let me turn the thing in what light I please, I cannot
discover the vis inertiæ, nor any effect of it. It is allowed
by all, that a body 1 <em>a</em> moving with a velocity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
1 <em>c</em>, and a force 1 <em>f</em> <em>striking another</em> body 1 <em>a</em> at rest,
they will afterwards <em>move on together</em>, each with ½ <em>c</em> and
½ <em>f</em>; which, as I said before, is equal in the whole to
1 <em>c</em> and 1 <em>f</em>. If vis inertiæ, as in this case, neither
abates the force nor the velocity of bodies, what does it,
or how does it discover itself?</p>

<p>I imagine I may venture to conclude my observations
on this piece, almost in the words of the author; that
if the doctrines of the immateriality of the soul and the
existence of God and of divine providence are demonstrable
from no plainer principles, the <em>deist</em> [i.e. <em>theist</em>]
has a desperate cause in hand. I oppose <em>my theist</em> to
his atheist, because I think they are diametrically opposite;
and not near of kin, as Mr. Whitfield seems to
suppose; where (in his journal) he tells us, "<em>M. B.
was a deist, I had almost said an atheist</em>;" that is, <em>chalk</em>, I
had almost said <em>charcoal</em>.</p>

<p>The din of the market<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> increases upon me; and

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven-Street, Jan. 6, 1758.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I return you Mr. Mitchell's paper on the strata
of the earth<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> with thanks. The reading of it, and perusal
of the draft that accompanies it, have reconciled
me to those convulsions which all naturalists agree this
globe has suffered. Had the different strata of clay,
gravel, marble, coals, lime-stone, sand, minerals, &amp;c.
continued to lie level, one under the other, as they may
be supposed to have done before those convulsions, we
should have had the use only of a few of the uppermost
of the strata, the others lying too deep and too difficult
to be come at; but the shell of the earth being broke,
and the fragments thrown into this oblique position, the
disjointed ends of a great number of strata of different
kinds are brought up to day, and a great variety of
useful materials put into our power, which would otherwise
have remained eternally concealed from us. So
that what has been usually looked upon as a <em>ruin</em> suffered
by this part of the universe, was, in reality, only a
preparation, or means of rendering the earth more fit
for use, more capable of being to mankind a convenient
and comfortable habitation.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Passy, September 22, 1782.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I return the papers with some corrections. I
did not find coal mines under the calcareous rock in
Derbyshire. I only remarked, that at the lowest part
of that rocky mountain which was in sight, there were
oyster shells mixed in the stone; and part of the high
county of Derby being probably as much above the
level of the sea, as the coal mines of Whitehaven were
below it, seemed a proof, that there had been a great
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouleversement</i> in the surface of that island, some part of
it having been depressed under the sea, and other parts,
which had been under it, being raised above it. Such
changes in the superficial parts of the globe, seemed to
me unlikely to happen, if the earth were solid to the centre.
I therefore imagined, that the internal parts might
be a fluid more dense, and of greater specific gravity than
any of the solids we are acquainted with, which therefore
might swim in or upon that fluid. Thus the surface
of the globe would be a shell, capable of being
broken and disordered by the violent movements of the
fluid on which it rested. And as air has been compressed
by art so as to be twice as dense as water, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
case, if such air and water could be contained in a
strong glass vessel, the air would be seen to take the
lowest place, and the water to float above and upon it;
and as we know not yet the degree of density to which
air may be compressed, and M. Amontons calculated,
that its density increasing as it approached the centre,
in the same proportion as above the surface, it would at
the depth of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] leagues, be heavier than gold, possibly
the dense fluid occupying the internal parts of the
globe might be air compressed. And as the force of
expansion in dense air when heated is in proportion to
its density, this central air might afford another agent
to move the surface, as well as be of use in keeping
alive the subterraneous fires; though, as you observe, the
sudden rarefaction of water coming into contact without
those fires, may also be an agent sufficiently strong
for that purpose, when acting between the incumbent
earth and the fluid on which it rests.</p>

<p>If one might indulge imagination in supposing how
such a globe was formed, I should conceive, that all
the elements in separate particles being originally mixed
in confusion, and occupying a great space, they would
(as soon as the almighty fiat ordained gravity, or the
mutual attraction of certain parts, and the mutual repulsion
of others, to exist) all move to their common
centre: that the air being a fluid whose parts repel each
other, though drawn to the common centre by their
gravity, would be densest towards the centre, and rarer
as more remote; consequently all matters lighter than
the central parts of that air, and immersed in it, would
recede from the centre, and rise till they arrived at that
region of the air which was of the same specific gravity
with themselves, where they would rest; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
other matter, mixed with the lighter air, would descend,
and the two meeting would form the shell of the first
earth, leaving the upper atmosphere nearly clear. The
original movement of the parts towards their common
centre would naturally form a whirl there; which would
continue upon the turning of the new-formed globe upon
its axis, and the greatest diameter of the shell would be
in its equator. If by any accident afterwards the axis
should be changed, the dense internal fluid, by altering
its form, must burst the shell, and throw all its substance
into the confusion in which we find it. I will
not trouble you at present with my fancies concerning
the manner of forming the rest of our system. Superior
beings smile at our theories, and at our presumption in
making them. I will just mention, that your observation
of the ferruginous nature of the lava which is thrown
out from the depths of our volcanoes, gave me great
pleasure. It has long been a supposition of mine, that
the iron contained in the surface of the globe has made
it capable of becoming, as it is, a great magnet; that
the fluid of magnetism perhaps exists in all space; so
that there is a magnetical north and south of the universe,
as well as of this globe, and that if it were possible
for a man to fly from star to star, he might govern
his course by the compass; that it was by the
power of this general magnetism this globe became a
particular magnet. In soft or hot iron the fluid of
magnetism is naturally diffused equally; when within
the influence of the magnet it is drawn to one end of
the iron, made denser there and rarer at the other.
While the iron continues soft and hot, it is only a temporary
magnet; if it cools or grows hard in that situation,
it becomes a permanent one, the magnetic fluid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
not easily resuming its equilibrium. Perhaps it may
be owing to the permanent magnetism of this globe,
which it had not at first, that its axis is at present kept
parallel to itself, and not liable to the changes it formerly
suffered, which occasioned the rupture of its
shell, the submersions and emersions of its lands and
the confusion of its seasons. The present polar and
equatorial diameters differing from each other near ten
leagues, it is easy to conceive, in case some power
should shift the axis gradually, and place it in the present
equator, and make the new equator pass through
the present poles, what a sinking of the waters would
happen in the present equatorial regions, and what a
rising in the present polar regions; so that vast tracts
would be discovered, that now are under water, and
others covered, that are now dry, the water rising and
sinking in the different extremes near five leagues.
Such an operation as this possibly occasioned much of
Europe, and among the rest this Mountain of Passy
on which I live, and which is composed of limestone,
rock and sea-shells, to be abandoned by the sea, and to
change its ancient climate, which seems to have been
a hot one. The globe being now become a perfect
magnet, we are, perhaps, safe from any change of its
axis. But we are still subject to the accidents on the
surface, which are occasioned by a wave in the internal
ponderous fluid; and such a wave is producible by
the sudden violent explosion you mention, happening
from the junction of water and fire under the earth,
which not only lifts the incumbent earth that is over
the explosion, but impressing with the same force the
fluid under it, creates a wave, that may run a thousand
leagues, lifting, and thereby shaking, successively, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the countries under which it passes. I know not, whether
I have expressed myself so clearly, as not to get
out of your sight in these reveries. It they occasion
any new enquiries, and produce a better hypothesis,
they will not be quite useless. You see I have given
a loose to imagination; but I approve much more your
method of philosophising, which proceeds upon actual
observation, makes a collection of facts, and concludes
no farther than those facts will warrant. In my present
circumstances, that mode of studying the nature
of the globe is out of my power, and therefore I have
permitted myself to wander a little in the wilds of
fancy. With great esteem,</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><em>P. S.</em> I have heard, that chymists can by their art
decompose stone and wood, extracting a considerable
quantity of water from the one, and air from the other.
It seems natural to conclude from this, that water and
air were ingredients in their original composition: for
men cannot make new matter of any kind. In the
same manner may we not suppose, that when we consume
combustibles of all kinds, and produce heat or
light, we do not create that heat or light; but only decompose
a substance, which received it originally as a
part of its composition? Heat may be thus considered
as originally in a fluid state; but, attracted by organized
bodies in their growth, becomes a part of the solid.
Besides this, I can conceive, that in the first assemblage
of the particles of which this earth is com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>posed,
each brought its portion of the loose heat that
had been connected with it, and the whole, when pressed
together, produced the internal fire that still subsists.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>New and curious Theory of Light and Heat.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2 small">[No date.]</p>

<p>Universal space, as far as we know of it, seems
to be filled with a subtle fluid, whose motion, or vibration,
is called light.</p>

<p>This fluid may possibly be the same with that, which,
being attracted by, and entering into other more solid
matter, dilates the substance by separating the constituent
particles, and so rendering some solids fluid, and
maintaining the fluidity of others; of which fluid,
when our bodies are totally deprived, they are said to
be frozen; when they have a proper quantity, they are
in health, and fit to perform all their functions; it is then
called natural heat; when too much, it is called fever;
and when forced into the body in too great a quantity
from without, it gives pain, by separating and destroying
the flesh, and is then called burning, and the fluid
so entering and acting is called fire.</p>

<p>While organised bodies, animal or vegetable, are
augmenting in growth, or are supplying their continual
waste, is not this done by attracting and consolidating
this fluid called fire, so as to form of it a part of their
substance? And is it not a separation of the parts of such
substance, which, dissolving its solid state, sets that
subtle fluid at liberty, when it again makes its appearance
as fire?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>For the power of man relative to matter, seems limited
to the separating or mixing the various kinds
of it, or changing its form and appearance by different
compositions of it; but does not extend to the making
or creating new matter, or annihilating the old. Thus,
if fire be an original element or kind of matter, its
quantity is fixed and permanent in the universe. We
cannot destroy any part of it, or make addition to it;
we can only separate it from that which confines it,
and so set it at liberty; as when we put wood in a
situation to be burnt, or transfer it from one solid to
another, as when we make lime by burning stone, a
part of the fire dislodged in the fuel being left in the
stone. May not this fluid, when at liberty, be capable
of penetrating and entering into all bodies, organised
or not, quitting easily in totality those not organised,
and quitting easily in part those which are; the part
assumed and fixed remaining till the body is dissolved?</p>

<p>Is it not this fluid which keeps asunder the particles
of air, permitting them to approach, or separating them
more, in proportion as its quantity is diminished or augmented?</p>

<p>Is it not the greater gravity of the particles of air,
which forces the particles of this fluid to mount with
the matters to which it is attached, as smoke or vapour?</p>

<p>Does it not seem to have a greater affinity with water,
since it will quit a solid to unite with that fluid, and
go off with it in vapour, leaving the solid cold to the
touch, and the degree measurable by the thermometer?</p>

<p>The vapour rises attached to this fluid, but at a
certain height they separate, and the vapour des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>cends
in rain, retaining but little of it, in snow or hail
less. What becomes of that fluid? Does it rise above
our atmosphere, and mix with the universal mass of
the same kind?</p>

<p>Or does a spherical stratum of it, denser, as less mixed
with air, attracted by this globe, and repelled or
pushed up only to a certain height from its surface, by
the greater weight of air, remain there surrounding the
globe, and proceeding with it round the sun?</p>

<p>In such case, as there may be a continuity or communication
of this fluid through the air quite down
to the earth, is it not by the vibrations given to it, by
the sun, that light appears to us? And may it not be,
that every one of the infinitely small vibrations, striking
common matter with a certain force, enters its substance,
is held there by attraction, and augmented
by succeeding vibrations, till the matter has received
as much as their force can drive into it?</p>

<p>Is it not thus, that the surface of this globe is continually
heated by such repeated vibrations in the day,
and cooled by the escape of the heat when those vibrations
are discontinued in the night, or intercepted and
reflected by clouds?</p>

<p>Is it not thus, that fire is amassed and makes the greatest
part of the substance of combustible bodies?</p>

<p>Perhaps, when this globe was first formed, and its
original particles took their place at certain distances
from the centre, in proportion to their greater or less
gravity, the fluid fire, attracted towards that centre,
might in great part be obliged, as lightest, to take
place above the rest, and thus form the sphere of fire
above supposed, which would afterwards be continually
diminishing by the substance it afforded to organised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bodies, and the quantity restored to it again, by the
burning or other separating of the parts of those bodies.</p>

<p>Is not the natural heat of animals thus produced, by
separating in digestion the parts of food, and setting
their fire at liberty?</p>

<p>Is it not this sphere of fire which kindles the wandering
globes that sometimes pass through it in our
course round the sun, have their surface kindled by it,
and burst when their included air is greatly rarefied by
the heat on their burning surfaces?</p>

<p>May it not have been from such considerations that
the ancient philosophers supposed a sphere of fire to
exist above the air of our atmosphere?</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Queries and Conjectures relating to Magnetism and the Theory of
the Earth.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2 small">[No date.]</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I received your favours by Messrs. Gore, Hilliard,
and Lee, with whose conversation I was much
pleased, and wished for more of it; but their stay with
us was too short. Whenever you recommend any of
your friends to me, you oblige me.</p>

<p>I want to know whether your Philosophical Society
received the second volume of our Transactions. I
sent it, but never heard of its arriving. If it miscarried,
I will send another. Has your Society among
its books the French work <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sur les Arts, et les Metiers</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
It is voluminous, well executed, and may be useful in
our country. I have bequeathed it them in my will;
but if they have it already, I will substitute something
else.</p>

<p>Our ancient correspondence used to have something
philosophical in it. As you are now more free from
public cares, and I expect to be so in a few months,
why may we not resume that kind of correspondence?
Our much regretted friend Winthrop once made me
the compliment, that I was good at starting game for
philosophers, let me try if I can start a little for you.</p>

<p>Has the question, how came the earth by its magnetism,
ever been considered?</p>

<p>Is it likely that <em>iron ore</em> immediately existed when this
globe was first formed; or may it not rather be supposed
a gradual production of time?</p>

<p>If the earth is at present magnetical, in virtue of the
masses of iron ore contained in it, might not some ages
pass before it had magnetic polarity?</p>

<p>Since iron ore may exist without that polarity, and
by being placed in certain circumstances may obtain
it, from an external cause, is it not possible that the
earth received its magnetism from some such cause?</p>

<p>In short, may not a magnetic power exist throughout
our system, perhaps through all systems, so that if
men could make a voyage in the starry regions, a compass
might be of use? And may not such universal
magnetism, with its uniform direction, be serviceable
in keeping the diurnal revolution of a planet more
steady to the same axis?</p>

<p>Lastly, as the poles of magnets may be changed by
the presence of stronger magnets, might not, in ancient
times, the near passing of some <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'larg ecomet'">large comet</ins> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
greater magnetic power than this globe of ours have
been a means of changing its poles, and thereby wrecking
and deranging its surface, placing in different regions
the effect of centrifugal force, so as to raise the
waters of the sea in some, while they were depressed in
others?</p>

<p>Let me add another question or two, not relating
indeed to magnetism, but, however, to the theory of
the earth.</p>

<p>Is not the finding of great quantities of shells and
bones of animals (natural to hot climates) in the cold
ones of our present world, some proof that its poles
have been changed? Is not the supposition that the
poles have been changed, the easiest way of accounting
for the deluge, by getting rid of the old difficulty how
to dispose of its waters after it was over? Since if the
poles were again to be changed, and placed in the present
equator, the sea would fall there about fifteen miles in
height, and rise as much in the present polar regions;
and the effect would be proportionable if the new poles
were placed any where between the present and the
equator.</p>

<p>Does not the apparent wreck of the surface of this
globe, thrown up into long ridges of mountains, with
strata in various positions, make it probable, that its
internal mass is a fluid; but a fluid so dense as to float
the heaviest of our substances? Do we know the limit
of condensation air is capable of? Supposing it to grow
denser <em>within</em> the surface, in the same proportion nearly
as it does <em>without</em>, at what depth may it be equal in
density with gold?</p>

<p>Can we easily conceive how the strata of the earth
could have been so deranged, if it had not been a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
shell supported by a heavier fluid? Would not such a
supposed internal fluid globe be immediately sensible
of a change in the situation of the earth's axis, alter its
form, and thereby burst the shell, and throw up parts
of it above the rest? As, if we would alter the position
of the fluid contained in the shell of an egg, and place
its longest diameter where the shortest now is, the shell
must break; but would be much harder to break; if
the whole internal substance were as solid and hard as
the shell.</p>

<p>Might not a wave, by any means raised in this supposed
internal ocean of extremely dense fluid, raise in
some degree, as it passes, the present shell of incumbent
earth, and break it in some places, as in earthquakes?
And may not the progress of such wave, and the disorders
it occasions among the solids of the shell, account
for the rumbling sound being first heard at a distance,
augmenting as it approaches, and gradually dying away
as it proceeds? A circumstance observed by the inhabitants
of South America in their last great earthquake,
that noise coming from a place, some degrees north of
Lima, and being traced by enquiry quite down to
Buenos Ayres, proceeded regularly from north to south
at the rate of [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] leagues per minute, as I was
informed by a very ingenious Peruvian whom I met
with at Paris.</p>

the surface of the earth; but as preceding convulsions
of nature had served to bring it very deep in many
places, and covered it with many different strata, we are
indebted to subsequent convulsions for having brought
within our view the extremities of its veins, so as to
lead us to penetrate the earth in search of it. I visited
last summer a large coal-mine at Whitehaven, in Cumberland;
and in following the vein and descending by
degrees towards the sea, I penetrated below the ocean,
where the level of its surface was more than eight hundred
fathom above my head, and the miners assured
me, that their works extended some miles beyond the
place where I then was, continually and gradually descending
under the sea. The slate, which forms the
roof of this coal mine, is impressed in many places with
the figures of leaves and branches of fern, which undoubtedly
grew at the surface when the slate was in the
state of sand on the banks of the sea. Thus it appears
that this vein of coal has suffered a prodigious settlement. ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Effect of Vegetation on noxious Air.</em></a></h3>

<p>**** That the vegetable creation should restore
the air which is spoiled by the animal part of it, looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
like a rational system, and seems to be of a piece with
the rest. Thus fire purifies water all the world over.
It purifies it by distillation, when it raises it in vapours,
and lets it fall in rain; and farther still by filtration,
when, keeping it fluid, it suffers that rain to percolate
the earth. We knew before, that putrid animal substances
were converted into sweet vegetables, when
mixed with the earth, and applied as manure; and now,
it seems, that the same putrid substances, mixed with
the air, have a similar effect. The strong thriving state
of your mint, in putrid air, seems to shew, that the air is
mended by taking something from it, and not by adding
to it. I hope this will give some check to the rage of
destroying trees that grow near houses, which has accompanied
our late improvements in gardening, from
an opinion of their being unwholesome. I am certain,
from long observation, that there is nothing unhealthy
in the air of woods; for we Americans have every where
our country habitations in the midst of woods, and no
people on earth enjoy better health, or are more
prolific. ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Inflammability of the Surface of certain Rivers in America.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven-street, April 10, 1774.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>In compliance with your request, I have endeavoured
to recollect the circumstances of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
experiments I formerly mentioned to you, of raising a
flame on the surface of some waters there.</p>

<p>When I passed through New Jersey in 1764, I heard
it several times mentioned, that by applying a lighted
candle near the surface of some of their rivers, a sudden
flame would catch and spread on the water, continuing
to burn for near half a minute. But the accounts I received
were so imperfect, that I could form no guess at
the cause of such an effect, and rather doubted the
truth of it. I had no opportunity of seeing the experiment;
but calling to see a friend who happened to be
just returning home <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'frome making'">from making</ins> it himself, I learned
from him the manner of it; which was to choose a shallow
place, where the bottom could be reached by a
walking-stick, and was muddy; the mud was first to be
stirred with the stick, and when a number of small bubbles
began to arise from it, the candle was applied. The
flame was so sudden and so strong, that it catched his
ruffle and spoiled it, as I saw. New Jersey having
many pine-trees in many parts of it, I then imagined
that something like a volatile oil of turpentine might be
mixed with the waters from a pine-swamp, but this
supposition did not quite satisfy me. I mentioned the
fact to some philosophical friends on my return to England,
but it was not much attended to. I suppose I was
thought a little too credulous.</p>

<p>In 1765, the Reverend Dr. Chandler received a letter
from Dr. Finley, President of the College in that province,
relating the same experiment. It was read at
the Royal Society, November 21 of that year, but not
printed in the Transactions; perhaps because it was
thought too strange to be true, and some ridicule might
be apprehended, if any member should attempt to repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it, in order to ascertain, or refute it. The following is
a copy of that account.</p>

<p>"A worthy gentleman, who lives at a few miles distance,
informed me, that in a certain small cove of a
mill-pond, near his house, he was surprized to see the
surface of the water blaze like inflamed spirits. I soon
after went to the place, and made the experiment with
the same success. The bottom of the creek was muddy,
and when stirred up, so as to cause a considerable curl
on the surface, and a lighted candle held within two or
three inches of it, the whole surface was in a blaze, as
instantly as the vapour of warm inflammable spirits,
and continued, when strongly agitated, for the space of
several seconds. It was at first imagined to be peculiar
to that place; but upon trial it was soon found, that
such a bottom in other places exhibited the same phenomenon.
The discovery was accidentally made by
one belonging to the mill."</p>

<p>I have tried the experiment twice here in England,
but without success. The first was in a slow running
water with a muddy bottom. The second in a stagnant
water at the bottom of a deep ditch. Being some time
employed in stirring this water, I ascribed an intermitting
fever, which seized me a few days after, to my
breathing too much of that foul air, which I stirred up
from the bottom, and which I could not avoid while I
stooped, endeavouring to kindle it. The discoveries you
have lately made, of the manner in which inflammable
air is in some cases produced, may throw light on
this experiment, and explain its succeeding in some
cases, and not in others. With the highest esteem and
respect,</p>

<h3 class="negidt1"><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the different Quantities of Rain which fall at different Heights
over the same Ground.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2">[No date.]</p>

<p>On my return to London I found your favour of the
16th of May (1771). I wish I could, as you desire,
give you a better explanation of the phenomenon in
question, since you seem not quite satisfied with your
own; but I think we want more and a greater variety
of experiments, in different circumstances, to enable us
to form a thoroughly satisfactory hypothesis. Not that
I make the least doubt of the facts already related, as I
know both Lord Charles Cavendish, and Dr. Heberden
to be very accurate experimenters: but I wish to know
the event of the trials proposed in your six queries; and
also, whether in the same place where the lower vessel
receives nearly twice the quantity of water that is received
by the upper, a third vessel placed at half the
height will receive a quantity proportionable. I will
however endeavour to explain to you what occurred to
me, when I first heard of the fact.</p>

<p>I suppose it will be generally allowed, on a little consideration
of the subject, that scarce any drop of water
was, when it began to fall from the clouds, of a magnitude
equal to that it has acquired, when it arrives at
the earth; the same of the several pieces of hail; because
they are often so large and so weighty, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
cannot conceive a possibility of their being suspended
in the air, and remaining at rest there, for any time,
how small soever; nor do we conceive any means of
forming them so large, before they set out to fall. It
seems then, that each beginning drop, and particle of
hail, receives continual addition in its progress downwards.
This may be several ways: by the union of
numbers in their course, so that what was at first only
descending mist, becomes a shower; or by each particle,
in its descent through air that contains a great
quantity of dissolved water, striking against, attaching
to itself, and carrying down with it such particles of that
dissolved water, as happen to be in its way; or attracting
to itself such as do not lie directly in its course by
its different state with regard either to common or electric
fire; or by all these causes united.</p>

<p>In the first case, by the uniting of numbers, larger
drops might be made, but the quantity falling in the
same place would be the same at all heights; unless,
as you mention, the whole should be contracted in falling,
the lines described by all the drops converging, so
that what set out to fall from a cloud of many thousand
acres, should reach the earth in perhaps a third of that
extent, of which I somewhat doubt. In the other cases
we have two experiments.</p>

<p>1. A dry glass bottle filled with very cold water, in a
warm day, will presently collect from the seemingly
dry air that surrounds it a quantity of water, that shall
cover its surface and run down its sides, which perhaps
is done by the power wherewith the cold water attracts
the fluid, common fire that had been united with the
dissolved water in the air, and drawing the fire through
the glass into itself, leaves the water on the outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>2. An electrified body left in a room for some time,
will be more covered with dust than other bodies in the
same room not electrified, which dust seems to be attracted
from the circumambient air.</p>

<p>Now we know that the rain, even in our hottest days,
comes from a very cold region. Its falling sometimes
in the form of ice, shows this clearly; and perhaps even
the rain is snow or ice, when it first moves downwards,
though thawed in falling: and we know that the drops
of rain are often electrified: but those causes of addition
to each drop of water, or piece of hail, one would
think could not long continue to produce the same effect;
since the air, through which the drops fall, must
soon be stripped of its previously dissolved water, so as
to be no longer capable of augmenting them. Indeed
very heavy showers, of either, are never of long continuance;
but moderate rains often continue so long as
to puzzle this hypothesis: so that upon the whole I
think, as I intimated before, that we are yet hardly ripe
for making one. ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Proposing a slowly sensible Hygrometer for certain Purposes.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Passy, near Paris, Nov. 13, 1780.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>The qualities hitherto sought in a hygrometer, or
instrument to discover the degrees of moisture and dryness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in the air, seem to have been, an aptitude to receive
humidity readily from a moist air, and to part
with it is as readily to a dry air. Different substances
have been found to possess more or less of this quality;
but when we shall have found the substance that has it
in the greatest perfection, there will still remain some
uncertainty in the conclusions to be drawn from the
degree shown by the instrument, arising from the actual
state of the instrument itself as to heat and cold.
Thus, if two bottles or vessels of glass or metal being
filled, the one with cold and the other with hot water,
are brought into a room, the moisture of the air in the
room will attach itself in quantities to the surface of the
cold vessel, while if you actually wet the surface of the
hot vessel, the moisture will immediately quit it, and
be absorbed by the same air. And thus, in a sudden
change of the air from cold to warm, the instrument
remaining longer cold may condense and absorb more
moisture, and mark the air as having become more humid
than it is in reality, and the contrary in a change
from warm to cold.</p>

<p>But if such a suddenly changing instrument could be
freed from these imperfections, yet when the design is
to discover the different degrees of humidity in the air
of different countries, I apprehend the quick sensibility
of the instrument to be rather a disadvantage;
since, to draw the desired conclusions from it, a constant
and frequent observation day and night in each
country will be necessary for a year or years, and the
mean of each different set of observations is to be found
and determined. After all which some uncertainty will
remain respecting the different degrees of exactitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with which different persons may have made and taken
notes of their observations.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I apprehend that a substance
which, though capable of being distended by moisture
and contracted by dryness, is so slow in receiving and
parting with its humidity, that the frequent changes in
the atmosphere have not time to affect it sensibly, and
which therefore should gradually take nearly the medium
of all those changes and preserve it constantly,
would be the most proper substance of which to make
such an hygrometer.</p>

<p>Such an instrument, you, my dear sir, though without
intending it, have made for me; and I, without desiring
or expecting it, have received from you. It is
therefore with propriety that I address to you the following
account of it; and the more, as you have both
a head to contrive and a hand to execute the means of
perfecting it. And I do this with greater pleasure, as
it affords me the opportunity of renewing that antient
correspondence and acquaintance with you, which to
me was always so pleasing and so instructive.</p>

<p>You may possibly remember, that in or about the
year 1758, you made for me a set of artificial magnets,
six in number, each five and a half inches long, half an
inch broad, and one eighth of an inch thick. These,
with two pieces of soft iron, which together equalled
one of the magnets, were inclosed in a little box of mahogany
wood, the grain of which ran with, and not
across, the length of the box: and the box was closed
by a little shutter of the same wood, the grain of which
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'ran acros'">ran across</ins> the box; and the ends of this shutting piece
were bevelled so as to fit and slide in a kind of dovetail
groove when the box was to be shut or opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been of opinion, that good mahogany wood
was not affected by moisture so as to change its dimensions,
and that it was always to be found as the tools of
the workman left it. Indeed the difference at different
times in the same country is so small as to be scarcely
in a common way observable. Hence the box, which
was made so as to allow sufficient room for the magnets
to slide out and in freely, and, when in, afforded them
so much play that by shaking the box one could make
them strike the opposite sides alternately, continued in
the same state all the time I remained in England,
which was four years, without any apparent alteration.
I left England in August 1762, and arrived at Philadelphia
in October the same year. In a few weeks after
my arrival, being desirous of showing your magnets to
a philosophical friend, I found them so tight in the box,
that it was with difficulty I got them out; and constantly
during the two years I remained there, viz. till
November 1764, this difficulty of getting them out and
in continued. The little shutter too, as wood does not
shrink lengthways of the grain, was found too long to
enter its grooves, and, not being used, was mislaid and
lost; and I afterwards had another made that fitted.</p>

<p>In December 1764 I returned to England, and after
some time I observed that my box was become full big
enough for my magnets, and too wide for my new shutter;
which was so much too short for its grooves, that
it was apt to fall out; and to make it keep in, I lengthened
it by adding to each end a little coat of sealing-wax.</p>

<p>I continued in England more than ten years, and
during all that time, after the first change, I perceived
no alteration. The magnets had the same freedom in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
their box, and the little shutter continued with the added
sealing-wax to fit its grooves, till some weeks after
my second return to America.</p>

<p>As I could not imagine any other cause for this
change of dimensions in the box, when in the different
countries, I concluded, first generally that the air of
England was moister than that of America. And this
I supposed an effect of its being an island, where every
wind that blew must necessarily pass over some sea before
it arrived, and of course lick up some vapour. I afterwards
indeed doubted whether it might be just only so
far as related to the city of London, where I resided;
because there are many causes of moisture in the city
air, which do not exist to the same degree in the country;
such as the brewers' and dyers' boiling caldrons,
and the great number of pots and tea-kettles continually
on the fire, sending forth abundance of vapour; and
also the number of animals who by their breath continually
increase it; to which may be added, that even
the vast quantity of sea coals burnt there, do in kindling
discharge a great deal of moisture.</p>

<p>When I was in England, the last time, you also
made for me a little achromatic pocket telescope, the
body was brass, and it had a round case (I think of
thin wood) covered with shagrin. All the while I remained
in England, though possibly there might be
some small changes in the dimensions of this case, I
neither perceived nor suspected any. There was always
comfortable room for the telescope to slip in and
out. But soon after I arrived in America, which was
in May 1775, the case became too small for the instrument,
it was with much difficulty and various contrivances
that I got it out, and I could never after get it
in again, during my stay there, which was eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
months. I brought it with me to Europe, but left the
case as useless, imagining that I should find the continental
air of France as dry as that of Pennsylvania,
where my magnet box had also returned a second time
to its narrowness, and pinched the pieces, as heretofore,
obliging me too, to scrape the sealing-wax off the ends
of the shutter.</p>

<p>I had not been long in France, before I was surprised
to find, that my box was become as large as it had always
been in England, the magnets entered and came
out with the same freedom, and, when in, I could rattle
them against its sides; this has continued to be the
case without sensible variation. My habitation is out
of Paris distant almost a league, so that the moist air
of the city cannot be supposed to have much effect
upon the box. I am on a high dry hill, in a free air, as
likely to be dry as any air in France. Whence it seems
probable that the air of England in general may, as well
as that of London, be moister than the air of America,
since that of France is so, and in a part so distant from
the sea.</p>

<p>The greater dryness of the air in America appears
from some other observations. The cabinet work formerly
sent us from London, which consisted in thin
plates of fine wood glued upon fir, never would stand
with us; the vaneering, as those plates are called, would
get loose and come off; both woods shrinking, and
their grains often crossing, they were forever cracking
and flying. And in my electrical experiments there, it
was remarkable, that a mahogany table, on which my
jars stood under the prime conductor to be charged,
would often be so dry, particularly when the wind had
been some time at north-west, which with us is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
drying wind, as to isolate the jars, and prevent their
being charged till I had formed a communication between
their coatings and the earth. I had a like table
in London, which I used for the same purpose all the
time I resided there; but it was never so dry as to refuse
conducting the electricity.</p>

<p>Now what I would beg leave to recommend to you,
is, that you would recollect, if you can, the species of
mahogany of which you made my box, for you know
there is a good deal of difference in woods that go under
that name; or if that cannot be, that you would take a
number of pieces of the closest and finest grained mahogany
that you can meet with, plane them to the thinness
of about a line, and the width of about two inches
across the grain, and fix each of the pieces in some instrument
that you can contrive, which will permit them
to contract and dilate, and will show, in sensible degrees,
by a moveable hand upon a marked scale, the
otherwise less sensible quantities of such contraction
and dilatation. If these instruments are all kept in the
same place while making, and are graduated together
while subject to the same degrees of moisture or dryness,
I apprehend you will have so many comparable
hygrometers, which, being sent into different countries,
and continued there for some time, will find and show
there the mean of the different dryness and moisture of
the air of those countries, and that with much less trouble
than by any hygrometer hitherto in use.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Relating a curious Instance of the Effect of Oil on Water.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Dec. 1, 1762.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>During our passage to Madeira, the weather being
warm, and the cabin windows constantly open for
the benefit of the air, the candles at night flared and
run very much, which was an inconvenience. At Madeira,
we got oil to burn, and with a common glass
tumbler or beaker, slung in wire, and suspended to the
cieling of the cabin, and a little wire hoop for the wick,
furnished with corks to float on the oil, I made an Italian
lamp, that gave us very good light all over the table.&mdash;The
glass at bottom contained water to about one
third of its height; another third was taken up with oil;
the rest was left empty that the sides of the glass might
protect the flame from the wind. There is nothing remarkable
in all this; but what follows is particular. At
supper, looking on the lamp, I remarked, that though
the surface of the oil was perfectly tranquil, and duly
preserved its position and distance with regard to the
brim of the glass, the water under the oil was in great
commotion, rising and falling in irregular waves, which
continued during the whole evening. The lamp was
kept burning as a watch light all night, till the oil was
spent, and the water only remained. In the morning I
observed, that though the motion of the ship continued
the same, the water was now quiet, and its surface as
tranquil as that of the oil had been the evening before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>At night again, when oil was put upon it, the water resumed
its irregular motions, rising in high waves almost
to the surface of the oil, but without disturbing the
smooth level of that surface. And this was repeated
every day during the voyage.</p>

<p>Since my arrival in America, I have repeated the experiment
frequently thus. I have put a pack-thread
round a tumbler, with strings of the same, from each
side, meeting above it in a knot at about a foot distance
from the top of the tumbler. Then putting in as much
water as would fill about one third part of the tumbler,
I lifted it up by the knot, and swung it to and fro in
the air; when the water appeared to keep its place in
the tumbler as steadily as if it had been ice. But pouring
gently in upon the water about as much oil, and
then again swinging it in the air as before, the tranquility
before possessed by the water, was transferred to
the surface of the oil, and the water under it was agitated
with the same commotions as at sea.</p>

<p>I have shewn this experiment to a number of ingenious
persons. Those who are but slightly acquainted
with the principles of hydrostatics, &amp;c. are apt to fancy
immediately that they understand it, and readily attempt
to explain it; but their explanations have been
different, and to me not very intelligible. Others, more
deeply skilled in those principles, seem to wonder at it,
and promise to consider it. And I think it is worth
considering: for a new appearance, if it cannot be explained
by our old principles, may afford us new ones,
of use perhaps in explaining some other obscure parts
of natural knowledge.</p>

<p>By the enclosed from an old friend, a worthy clergyman
at Carlisle, whose great learning and extensive
knowledge in most sciences would have more distinguished
him, had he been placed in a more conspicuous
point of view, you will find, that he had heard of your
experiment on Derwent Lake, and has thrown together
what he could collect on that subject; to which I have
subjoined one experiment from the relation of another
gentleman.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Extract of a Letter from the Rev. Mr. Farish, to Dr.
Brownrigg.</em></p>

<p>I some time ago met with Mr. Dun, who surprised
me with an account of an experiment you had tried upon
the Derwent Water, in company with Sir John Pringle
and Dr. Franklin. According to his representation,
the water, which had been in great agitation before,
was instantly calmed upon pouring in only a very small
quantity of oil, and that to so great a distance round the
boat as seemed incredible. I have since had the same
accounts from others, but I suspect all of a little exaggeration.
Pliny mentions this property of oil as known
particularly to the divers, who made use of it in his days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in order to have a more steady light at the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The sailors, I have been told, have observed something
of the same kind in our days, that the water is always
remarkably smoother, in the wake of a ship that has
been newly tallowed, than it is in one that is foul. Mr.
Pennant also mentions an observation of the like nature
made by the seal catchers in Scotland. <cite>Brit. Zool.</cite> Vol.
IV. <em>Article</em> Seal. When these animals are devouring a
very oily fish, which they always do under water, the
waves alone are observed to be remarkably smooth, and
by this mark the fishermen know where to look for
them. Old Pliny does not usually meet with all the
credit I am inclined to think he deserves. I shall be
glad to have an authentic account of the Keswick experiment,
and if it comes up to the representations that
have been made of it, I shall not much hesitate to believe
the old gentleman in another more wonderful
phenomenon he relates of stilling a tempest only by
throwing up a little vinegar into the air.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I thank you for the remarks of your learned friend
at Carlisle. I had, when a youth, read and smiled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Pliny's account of a practice among the seamen of his
time, to still the waves in a storm by pouring oil into
the sea; which he mentions, as well as the use made of
oil by the divers; but the stilling a tempest by throwing
vinegar into the air had escaped me. I think with
your friend, that it has been of late too much the mode
to slight the learning of the ancients. The learned,
too, are apt to slight too much the knowledge of the
vulgar. The cooling by evaporation was long an instance
of the latter. This art of smoothing the waves
by oil is an instance of both.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may not dislike to have an account of
all I have heard, and learnt, and done in this way.
Take it if you please as follows.</p>

<p>In 1757, being at sea in a fleet of 96 sail bound against
Louisbourg, I observed the wakes of two of the ships
to be remarkably smooth, while all the others were ruffled
by the wind, which blew fresh. Being puzzled
with the differing appearance, I at last pointed it out
to our captain, and asked him the meaning of it. "The
cooks," says he, "have, I suppose, been just emptying
their greasy water through the scuppers, which has
greased the sides of those ships a little;" and this answer
he gave me with an air of some little contempt, as
to a person ignorant of what every body else knew. In
my own mind I at first slighted his solution, though I
was not able to think of another, but recollecting what
I had formerly read in Pliny, I resolved to make some
experiment of the effect of oil on water, when I should
have opportunity.</p>

<p>Afterwards being again at sea in 1762, I first observed
the wonderful quietness of oil on agitated water, in the
swinging glass lamp I made to hang up in the cabin, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
described in my printed papers<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. This I was continually
looking at and considering, as an appearance
to me inexplicable. An old sea captain, then
a passenger with me, thought little of it, supposing
it an effect of the same kind with that of oil put
on water to smooth it, which he said was a practice
of the Bermudians when they would strike fish,
which they could not see, if the surface of the water was
ruffled by the wind. This practice I had never before
heard of, and was obliged to him for the information;
though I thought him mistaken as to the sameness of
the experiment, the operations being different as well
as the effects. In one case, the water is smooth till the
oil is put on, and then becomes agitated. In the other
it is agitated before the oil is applied, and then becomes
smooth. The same gentleman told me, he had heard it
was a practice with the fisherman of Lisbon when about
to return into the river (if they saw before them too
great a surf upon the bar, which they apprehended
might fill their boats in passing) to empty a bottle or
two of oil into the sea, which would suppress the breakers,
and allow them to pass safely. A confirmation of
this I have not since had an opportunity of obtaining:
but discoursing of it with another person, who had
often been in the Mediterranean, I was informed, that
the divers there, who, when under water in their business,
need light, which the curling of the surface interrupts
by the refractions of so many little waves, let a
small quantity of oil now and then out of their mouths,
which rising to the surface smooths it, and permits the
light to come down to them. All these informations I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
at times revolved in my mind, and wondered to find no
mention of them in our books of experimental philosophy.</p>

<p>At length being at Clapham, where there is, on the
common, a large pond, which I observed one day to be
very rough with the wind, I fetched out a cruet of oil,
and dropt a little of it on the water. I saw it spread
itself with surprising swiftness upon the surface; but
the effect of smoothing the waves was not produced;
for I had applied it first on the leeward side of the
pond, where the waves were largest, and the wind
drove my oil back upon the shore. I then went to the
windward side where they began to form; and there
the oil, though not more than a tea spoonful, produced
an instant calm over a space several yards square, which
spread amazingly, and extended itself gradually till it
reached the lee side, making all that quarter of the
pond, perhaps half an acre, as smooth as a looking-glass.</p>

<p>After this I contrived to take with me, whenever I
went into the country, a little oil in the upper hollow
joint of my bamboo cane, with which I might repeat
the experiment as opportunity should offer, and I found
it constantly to succeed.</p>

<p>In these experiments, one circumstance struck me
with particular surprise. This was the sudden, wide
and forcible spreading of a drop of oil on the face of the
water, which I do not know that any body has hitherto
considered. If a drop of oil is put on a highly polished
marble table, or on a looking-glass that lies horizontally,
the drop remains in its place, spreading very
little. But when put on water, it spreads instantly many
feet round, becoming so thin as to produce the prisma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>tic
colours, for a considerable space, and beyond them
so much thinner as to be invisible, except in its effect
of smoothing the waves at a much greater distance.
It seems as if a mutual repulsion between its particles
took place as soon as it touched the water, and a repulsion
so strong as to act on other bodies swimming on
the surface, as straw, leaves, chips, &amp;c. forcing them to
recede every way from the drop, as from a centre, leaving
a large clear space. The quantity of this force,
and the distance to which it will operate, I have not
yet ascertained; but I think it a curious enquiry, and
I wish to understand whence it arises.</p>

<p>In our journey to the north, when we had the pleasure
of seeing you at Ormathwaite, we visited the celebrated
Mr. Smeaton, near Leeds. Being about to show
him the smoothing experiment on a little pond near his
house, an ingenious pupil of his, Mr. Jessop, then present,
told us of an odd appearance on that pond, which
had lately occurred to him. He was about to clean a
little cup in which he kept oil, and he threw upon the
water some flies that had been drowned in the oil.
These flies presently began to move, and turned round
on the water very rapidly, as if they were vigorously
alive, though on examination he found they were not
so. I immediately concluded that the motion was occasioned
by the power of the repulsion above mentioned,
and that the oil issuing gradually from the
spungy body of the fly continued the motion. He
found some more flies drowned in oil, with which the
experiment was repeated before us. To show that it
was not any effect of life recovered by the flies, I imitated
it by little bits of oiled chips and paper cut in the
form of a comma, of the size of a common fly; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the stream of repelling particles issuing from the point
made the comma turn round the contrary way. This
is not a chamber experiment; for it cannot be well repeated
in a bowl or dish of water on a table. A considerable
surface of water is necessary to give room for
the expansion of a small quantity of oil. In a dish of
water, if the smallest drop of oil be let fall in the middle,
the whole surface is presently covered with a thin
greasy film proceeding from the drop; but as soon as
that film has reached the sides of the dish, no more
will issue from the drop, but it remains in the form of
oil, the sides of the dish putting a stop to its dissipation
by prohibiting the farther expansion of the film.</p>

<p>Our friend Sir John Pringle, being soon after in Scotland,
learned there, that those employed in the herring-fishery
could at a distance see where the shoals of herrings
were, by the smoothness of the water over them,
which might possibly be occasioned, he thought, by
some oiliness proceeding from their bodies.</p>

<p>A gentleman from Rhode-island told me, it had been
remarked, that the harbour of Newport was ever smooth
while any whaling vessels were in it; which probably
arose from hence, that the blubber which they sometimes
bring loose in the hold, or the leakage of their
barrels, might afford some oil, to mix with that water,
which from time to time they pump out to keep their
vessel free, and that some oil might spread over the
surface of the water in the harbour, and prevent the
forming of any waves.</p>

<p>This prevention I would thus endeavour to explain.</p>

<p>There seems to be no natural repulsion <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'betwween water'">between water</ins>
and air, such as to keep them from coming into
contact with each other. Hence we find a quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
air in water; and if we extract it by means of the air-pump,
the same water, again exposed to the air, will soon
imbibe an equal quantity.</p>

<p>Therefore air in motion, which is wind, in passing
over the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'smoth surface'">smooth surface</ins> of water, may rub, as it were,
upon that surface, and raise it into wrinkles, which, if
the wind continues, are the elements of future waves.</p>

<p>The smallest wave once raised does not immediately
subside, and leave the neighbouring water quiet: but in
subsiding raises nearly as much of the water next to it,
the friction of the parts making little difference. Thus
a stone dropped in a pool raises first a single wave round
itself; and leaves it, by sinking to the bottom; but that
first wave subsiding raises a second, the second a third,
and so on in circles to a great extent.</p>

<p>A small power continually operating will produce a
great action. A finger applied to a weighty suspended
bell can at first move it but little; if repeatedly applied,
though with no greater strength, the motion increases
till the bell swings to its utmost height, and with a force
that cannot be resisted by the whole strength of the
arm and body. Thus the small first-raised waves, being
continually acted upon by the wind, are, though the
wind does not increase in strength, continually increased
in magnitude, rising higher and extending their bases,
so as to include a vast mass of water in each wave,
which in its motion acts with great violence.</p>

<p>But if there be a mutual repulsion between the particles
of oil, and no attraction between oil and water, oil
dropped on water will not be held together by adhesion
to the spot whereon it falls; it will not be imbibed by
the water; it will be at liberty to expand itself; and it
will spread on a surface that, besides being smooth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the most perfect degree of polish, prevents, perhaps by
repelling the oil, all immediate contact, keeping it at a
minute distance from itself; and the expansion will continue
till the mutual repulsion between the particles of
the oil is weakened and reduced to nothing by their
distance.</p>

<p>Now I imagine that the wind, blowing over water thus
covered with a film of oil, cannot easily <em>catch</em> upon it,
so as to raise the first wrinkles, but slides over it, and
leaves it smooth as it finds it. It moves a little the oil
indeed, which being between it and the water, serves it
to slide with, and prevents friction, as oil does between
those parts of a machine, that would otherwise rub hard
together. Hence the oil dropped on the windward side
of a pond proceeds gradually to leeward, as may be
seen by the smoothness it carries with it, quite to the
opposite side. For the wind being thus prevented from
raising the first wrinkles, that I call the elements of
waves, cannot produce waves, which are to be made by
continually acting upon, and enlarging those elements,
and thus the whole pond is calmed.</p>

<p>Totally therefore we might suppress the waves in any
required place, if we could come at the windward place
where they take their rise. This in the ocean can seldom
if ever be done. But perhaps something may be
done on particular occasions, to moderate the violence
of the waves when we are in the midst of them, and
prevent their breaking where that would be inconvenient.</p>

<p>For when the wind blows fresh, there are continually
rising on the back of every great wave a number of
small ones, which roughen its surface, and give the
wind hold, as it were, to push it with greater force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
This hold is diminished, by preventing the generation
of those small ones. And possibly too, when a wave's
surface is oiled, the wind, in passing over it, may rather
in some degree press it down, and contribute to prevent
it, rising again, instead of promoting it.</p>

<p>This as mere conjecture would have little weight, if
the apparent effects of pouring oil into the midst of
waves were not considerable, and as yet not otherwise
accounted for.</p>

<p>When the wind blows so fresh, as that the waves
are not sufficiently quick in obeying its impulse, their
tops being thinner and lighter are pushed forward,
broken, and turned over in a white foam. Common
waves lift a vessel without entering it; but these when
large sometimes break above and pour over it, doing
great damage.</p>

<p>That this effect might in any degree be prevented,
or the height and violence of waves in the sea moderated,
we had no certain account; Pliny's authority
for the practice of seamen in his time being slighted.
But discoursing lately on this subject with his excellency
Count Bentinck, of Holland, his son the honourable
Captain Bentinck, and the learned professor Allemand
(to all whom I showed the experiment of smoothing
in a windy day the large piece of water at the head
of the Green Park) a letter was mentioned, which had
been received by the Count from Batavia, relative to
the saving of a Dutch ship in a storm by pouring oil
into the sea. I much desired to see that letter, and
a copy of it was promised me, which I afterward
received.</p>

take up with a proper instrument. This Sir Gilfred had often seen there
performed, and said the same was practised on other parts of the Spanish
coast.</p></div>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Extract of a Letter from Mr. Tengnagel to Count Bentinck,
dated at Batavia, the 5th of January, 1770.</em></a></h3>

<p>"Near the islands Paul and Amsterdam, we met
with a storm, which had nothing particular in it worthy
of being communicated to you, except that the captain
found himself obliged for greater safety in wearing the
ship, to pour oil into the sea, to prevent the waves
breaking over her, which had an excellent effect, and
succeeded in preserving us. As he poured out but a
little at a time, the East India Company owes perhaps
its ship to only six demi-ames of oil-olive. I was present
upon deck when this was done; and I should not
have mentioned this circumstance to you, but that we
have found people here so prejudiced against the experiment,
as to make it necessary for the officers on board
and myself to give a certificate of the truth on this head,
of which we made no difficulty."</p>

<p>On this occasion, I mentioned to Captain Bentinck,
a thought which had occurred to me in reading the
voyages of our late circumnavigators, particularly
where accounts are given of pleasant and fertile islands
which they much desired to land upon, when sickness
made it more necessary, but could not effect a landing
through a violent surf breaking on the shore, which
rendered it impracticable. My idea was, that possibly
by sailing to and fro at some distance from such lee-shore,
continually pouring oil into the sea, the waves
might be so much depressed, and lessened before they
reached the shore, as to abate the height and violence
of the surf, and permit a landing; which, in such circumstances,
was a point of sufficient importance to justify
the expense of the oil that might be requisite for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the purpose. That gentleman, who is ever ready to
promote what may be of public utility, though his own
ingenious inventions have not always met with the
countenance they merited, was so obliging as to invite
me to Portsmouth, where an opportunity would probably
offer, in the course of a few days, of making
the experiment on some of the shores about Spithead,
in which he kindly proposed to accompany me, and to
give assistance with such boats as might be necessary.
Accordingly, about the middle of October last, I went
with some friends to Portsmouth; and a day of wind
happening, which made a lee-shore between Haslar-hospital
and the point near Jillkecker, we went from
the Centaur with the long-boat and barge towards that
shore. Our disposition was this: the long-boat was
anchored about a quarter of a mile from the shore;
part of the company were landed behind the point
(a place more sheltered from the sea) who came round
and placed themselves opposite to the long-boat, where
they might observe the surf, and note if any change
occurred in it upon using the oil. Another party, in
the barge, plied to windward of the long-boat, as far
from her as she was from the shore, making trips of
about half a mile each, pouring oil continually out of
a large stone-bottle, through a hole in the cork, somewhat
bigger than a goose-quill. The experiment had
not, in the main point, the success we wished, for no
material difference was observed in the height or force
of the surf upon the shore; but those who were in the
long-boat could observe a tract of smoothed water, the
whole of the distance in which the barge poured the
oil, and gradually spreading in breadth towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
long-boat. I call it smoothed, not that it was laid level;
but because, though the swell continued, its surface
was not roughened by the wrinkles, or smaller
waves, before-mentioned; and none or very few white
caps (or waves whose tops turn over in foam) appeared
in that whole space, though to windward and leeward
of it there were plenty; and a wherry, that came round
the point under sail, in her way to Portsmouth, seemed
to turn into that tract of choice, and to use it from
end to end, as a piece of turnpike-road.</p>

<p>It may be of use to relate the circumstances of an
experiment that does not succeed, since they may give
hints of amendment in future trials: it is therefore I
have been thus particular. I shall only add what I
apprehend may have been the reason of our disappointment.</p>

<p>I conceive, that the operation of oil on water is, first,
to prevent the raising of new waves by the wind; and,
secondly, to prevent its pushing those before raised
with such force, and consequently their continuance
of the same repeated height, as they would have done,
if their surface were not oiled. But oil will not prevent
waves being raised by another power, by a stone, for
instance, falling into a still pool; for they then rise by
the mechanical impulse of the stone, which the greasiness
on the surrounding water cannot lessen or prevent,
as it can prevent the winds catching the surface and
raising it into waves. Now waves once raised, whether
by the wind or any other power, have the same mechanical
operation, by which they continue to rise and
fall, as a <em>pendulum</em> will continue to swing, a long time
after the force ceases to act by which the motion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
first produced: that motion will, however, cease in
time; but time is necessary. Therefore, though oil
spread on an agitated sea may weaken the push of the
wind on those waves whose surfaces are covered by it,
and so, by receiving less fresh impulse, they may gradually
subside; yet a considerable time, or a distance
through which they will take time to move, may be
necessary to make the effect sensible on any shore in a
diminution of the surf: for we know, that when wind
ceases suddenly, the waves it has raised do not as suddenly
subside, but settle gradually, and are not quite
down till after the wind has ceased. So though we
should, by oiling them, take off the effect of wind on
waves already raised, it is not to be expected that those
waves should be instantly levelled. The motion they
have received will, for some time, continue; and if
the shore is not far distant, they arrive there so soon,
that their effect upon it will not be visibly diminished.
Possibly, therefore, if we had begun our operations at a
greater distance, the effect might have been more sensible.
And perhaps we did not pour oil in sufficient
quantity. Future experiments may determine this.</p>

<p>I was, however, greatly obliged to Captain Bentinck,
for the chearful and ready aids he gave me: and I
ought not to omit mentioning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,
General Carnoc, and Dr. Blagden, who all assisted
at the experiment, during that blustering unpleasant
day, with a patience and activity that could only
be inspired by a zeal for the improvement of knowledge,
such especially as might possibly be of use to
men in situations of distress.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven-street, May 10, 1768.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>You may remember, that when, we were travelling together
in Holland, you remarked, that the trackschuyt in
one of the stages went slower than usual, and enquired
of the boatman, what might be the reason; who answered,
that it had been a dry season, and the water in
the canal was low. On being again asked if it was so
low as that the boat touched the muddy bottom; he
said, no, not so low as that, but so low as to make it
harder for the horse to draw the boat. We neither of
us at first could conceive that if there was water enough
for the boat to swim clear of the bottom, its being
deeper would make any difference; but as the man affirmed
it seriously as a thing well known among them;
and as the punctuality required in their stages was
likely to make such difference, if any there were, more
readily observed by them, than by other watermen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
did not pass so regularly and constantly backwards and
forwards in the same track; I began to apprehend
there might be something in it, and attempted to account
for it from this consideration, that the boat in
proceeding along the canal, must in every boat's length
of her course, move out of her way a body of water,
equal in bulk to the room her bottom took up in the
water; that the water so moved must pass on each side
of her and under her bottom to get behind her; that if
the passage under her bottom was straitened by the
shallows, more of that water must pass by her sides, and
with a swifter motion, which would retard her, as moving
the contrary way; or that the water becoming
lower behind the boat than before, she was pressed back
by the weight of its difference in height, and her motion
retarded by having that weight constantly to overcome.
But as it is often lost time to attempt accounting
for uncertain facts, I determined to make an experiment
of this when I should have convenient time and
opportunity.</p>

<p>After our return to England, as often as I happened
to be on the Thames, I enquired of our watermen whether
they were sensible of any difference in rowing over
shallow or deep water. I found them all agreeing in
the fact, that there was a very great difference, but
they differed widely in expressing the quantity of the
difference; some supposing it was equal to a mile in
six, others to a mile in three, &amp;c. As I did not recollect
to have met with any mention of this matter in
our philosophical books, and conceiving that if the difference
should really be great, it might be an object of
consideration in the many projects now on foot for digging
new navigable canals in this island, I lately put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
my design of making the experiment in execution, in
the following manner.</p>

<p>I provided a trough of plained boards fourteen feet
long, six inches wide and six inches deep, in the clear,
filled with water within half an inch of the edge, to
represent a canal. I had a loose board of nearly the
same length and breadth, that, being put into the water,
might be sunk to any depth, and fixed by little wedges
where I would chuse to have it stay, in order to make
different depths of water, leaving the surface at the
same height with regard to the sides of the trough. I
had a little boat in form of a lighter or boat of burthen,
six inches long, two inches and a quarter wide, and
one inch and a quarter deep. When swimming, it drew
one inch water. To give motion to the boat, I fixed
one end of a long silk thread to its bow, just even with
the water's edge, the other end passed over a well-made
brass pully, of about an inch diameter, turning
freely on a small axis; and a shilling was the weight.
Then placing the boat at one end of the trough, the
weight would draw it through the water to the
other.</p>

<p>Not having a watch that shows seconds, in order to
measure the time taken up by the boat in passing from
end to end, I counted as fast as I could count to ten
repeatedly, keeping an account of the number of tens
on my fingers. And as much as possible to correct any
little inequalities in my counting, I repeated the experiment
a number of times at each depth of water, that I
might take the medium. And the following are the
results.</p>

<p>I made many other experiments, but the above are
those in which I was most exact; and they serve sufficiently
to show that the difference is considerable. Between
the deepest and shallowest it appears to be somewhat
more than one fifth. So that supposing large
canals and boats and depths of water to bear the same
proportions, and that four men or horses would draw a
boat in deep water four leagues in four hours, it would
require five to draw the same boat in the same time as
far in shallow water; or four would require five hours.</p>

<p>Whether this difference is of consequence enough to
justify a greater expence in deepening canals, is a matter
of calculation, which our ingenious engineers in that
way will readily determine.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Aug. 1785.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>Your learned writings on the navigation of the antients,
which contain a great deal of curious information,
and your very ingenious contrivances for improving
the modern sails (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voilure</i>) of which I saw with great
pleasure a successful trial on the river Seine, have induced
me to submit to your consideration and judgment,
some thoughts I have had on the latter subject.</p>

<p>Those mathematicians, who have endeavoured to improve
the swiftness of vessels, by calculating to find the
form of least resistance, seem to have considered a ship
as a body moving through one fluid only, the water;
and to have given little attention to the circumstance of
her moving through another fluid, the air. It is true
that when a vessel sails right before the wind, this circumstance
is of no importance, because the wind goes
with her; but in every deviation from that course, the
resistance of the air is something, and becomes greater
in proportion as that deviation increases. I wave at
present the consideration of those different degrees of
resistance given by the air to that part of the hull which
is above water, and confine myself to that given to the
sails; for their motion through the air is resisted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>air, as the motion of the hull through the water is resisted
by the water, though with less force as the air is
a lighter fluid. And to simplify the discussion as much
as possible, I would state one situation only, to wit, that
of the wind upon the beam, the ship's course being directly
across the wind; and I would suppose the sail set
in an angle of 45 degrees with the keel, as in the following
figure; wherein (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate VI</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>A B represents the body of the vessel, C D the
position of the sail, EEE the direction of the wind,
MM the line of motion. In observing this figure
it will appear, that so much of the body of the vessel
as is immersed in the water must, to go forward,
remove out of its way what water it meets with between
the pricked lines FF. And the sail, to go forward, must
move out of its way all the air its whole dimension
meets with between the pricked lines CG and DG.
Thus both the fluids give resistance to the motion, each
in proportion to the quantity of matter contained in the
dimension to be removed. And though the air is vastly
lighter than the water, and therefore more easily removed,
yet the dimension being much greater its effect
is very considerable.</p>

<p>It is true that in the case stated, the resistance given
by the air between those lines to the motion of the sail
is not apparent to the eye, because the greater force of
the wind, which strikes it in the direction EEE, overpowers
its effect, and keeps the sail full in the curve a,
a, a, a, a. But suppose the wind to cease, and the vessel
in a calm to be impelled with the same swiftness by
oars, the sail would then appear filled in the contrary
curve b, b, b, b, b, when prudent men would imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>diately
perceive, that the air resisted its motion, and
would order it to be taken in.</p>

<p>Is there any possible means of diminishing this resistance,
while the same quantity of sail is exposed to the
action of the wind, and therefore the same force obtained
from it? I think there is, and that it may be done
by dividing the sail into a number of parts, and placing
those parts in a line one behind the other; thus instead
of one sail extending from C to D, figure 2, if four sails
containing together the same quantity of canvas, were
placed as in figure 3, each having one quarter of the
dimensions of the great sail, and exposing a quarter of
its surface to the wind, would give a quarter of the
force; so that the whole force obtained from the wind
would be the same, while the resistance from the air
would be nearly reduced to the space between the
pricked lines <em>a b</em> and <em>c d</em>, before the foremost sail.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be doubted whether the resistance
from the air would be so diminished; since possibly
each of the following small sails having also air before
it, which must be removed, the resistance on the whole
would be the same.</p>

<p>This is then a matter to be determined by experiment.
I will mention one that I many years since
made with success for another purpose; and I will propose
another small one easily made. If that too succeeds,
I should think it worth while to make a larger,
though at some expense, on a river boat; and perhaps
time, and the improvements experience will afford, may
make it applicable with advantage to larger vessels.</p>

<p>Having near my kitchen chimney a round hole of
eight inches diameter, through which was a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
steady current of air, increasing or diminishing only as
the fire increased or diminished, I contrived to place
my jack so as to receive that current; and taking off
the flyers, I fixed in their stead on the same pivot a
round tin plate of nearly the same diameter with the
hole; and having cut it in radial lines almost to the
centre, so as to have six equal vanes, I gave to each
of them the obliquity of forty-five degrees. They
moved round, without the weight, by the impression
only of the current of air, but too slowly for the purpose
of roasting. I suspected that the air struck by
the back of each vane might possibly by its resistance
retard the motion; and to try this, I cut each of them
into two, and I placed the twelve, each having the same
obliquity, in a line behind each other, when I perceived
a great augmentation in its velocity, which encouraged
me to divide them once more, and, continuing the same
obliquity, I placed the twenty-four behind each other
in a line, when the force of the wind being the same,
and the surface of vane the same, they moved round
with much greater rapidity, and perfectly answered my
purpose.</p>

<p>The second experiment that I propose, is, to take
two playing cards of the same dimensions, and cut one
of them transversely into eight equal pieces; then with
a needle string them upon two threads one near each
end, and place them so upon the threads that, when
hung up, they may be one exactly over the other, at a
distance equal to their breadth, each in a horizontal
position; and let a small weight, such as a bird-shot, be
hung under them, to make them fall in a straight line
when let loose. Suspend also the whole card by threads
from its four corners, and hang to it an equal weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
so as to draw it downwards when let fall, its whole
breadth pressing against the air. Let those two bodies
be attached, one of them to one end of a thread a yard
long, the other to the other end. Extend a twine under
the ceiling of a room, and put through it at thirty
inches distance two pins bent in the form of fish-hooks.
On these two hooks hang the two bodies, the thread
that connects them extending parallel to the twine,
which thread being cut, they must begin to fall at the
same instant. If they take equal time in falling to the
floor, it is a proof that the resistance of the air is in
both cases equal. If the whole card requires a longer
time, it shows that the sum of the resistances to the
pieces of the cut card is not equal to the resistance of
the whole one<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>This principle so far confirmed, I would proceed to
make a larger experiment, with a shallop, which I
would rig in this manner. (<a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate VI.</a> Fig. 4.)</p>

<p>A B is a long boom, from which are hoisted seven
jibs, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, each a seventh part of
the whole dimensions, and as much more as will fill
the whole space when set in an angle of forty-five
degrees, so that they may lap when going before the
wind, and hold more wind when going large. Thus
rigged, when going right before the wind, the boom
should be brought at right angles with the keel, by
means of the sheet ropes C D, and all the sails hauled
flat to the boom.</p>

<p>These positions of boom and sails to be varied as the
wind quarters. But when the wind is on the beam, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
when you would turn to windward, the boom is to be
hauled right fore and aft, and the sails trimmed according
as the wind is more or less against your course.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that the management of a shallop so
rigged would be very easy, the sails being run up and
down separately, so that more or less sail may be made
at pleasure; and I imagine, that there being full as
much sail exposed to the force of the wind which impels
the vessel in its course, as if the whole were in one
piece, and the resistance of the dead air against the
foreside of the sail being diminished, the advantage of
swiftness would be very considerable; besides that the
vessel would lie nearer the wind.</p>

<p>Since we are on the subject of improvements in navigation,
permit me to detain you a little longer with a
small relative observation. Being, in one of my voyages,
with ten merchant-ships under convoy of a frigate
at anchor in Torbay, waiting for a wind to go to the
westward; it came fair, but brought in with it a considerable
swell. A signal was given for weighing, and
we put to sea all together; but three of the ships left
their anchors, their cables parting just as the anchors
came a-peak. Our cable held, and we got up our anchor;
but the shocks the ship felt before the anchor
got loose from the ground, made me reflect on what
might possibly have caused the breaking of the other
cables; and I imagined it might be the short bending
of the cable just without the hause-hole, from a horizontal
to an almost vertical position, and the sudden
violent jerk it receives by the rising of the head of the
ship on the swell of a wave while in that position. For
example, suppose a vessel hove up so as to have her
head nearly over her anchor, which still keeps its hold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
perhaps in a tough bottom; if it were calm, the cable
still out would form nearly a perpendicular line, measuring
the distance between the hause-hole and the anchor;
but if there is a swell, her head in the trough of
the sea will fall below the level, and when lifted on the
wave will be much above it. In the first case the cable
will hang loose and bend perhaps as in figure 5. In
the second case, figure 6, the cable will be drawn straight
with a jerk, must sustain the whole force of the rising
ship, and must either loosen the anchor, resist the rising
force of the ship, or break. But why does it break at
the hause-hole?</p>

<p>Let us suppose it a cable of three inches diameter,
and represented by figure 7. If this cable is to be bent
round the corner A, it is evident that either the part of
the triangle contained between the letters a, b, c, must
stretch considerably, and those most that are nearest
the surface; or that the parts between d, e, f, must be
compressed; or both, which most probably happens.
In this case the lower half of the thickness affords no
strength against the jerk, it not being strained, the upper
half bears the whole, and the yarns near the upper
surface being first and most strained, break first, and
the next yarns follow; for in this bent situation they
cannot bear the strain all together, and each contributes
its strength to the whole, as they do when the cable is
strained in a straight line.</p>

<p>To remedy this, methinks it would be well to have a
kind of large pulley wheel, fixed in the hause-hole, suppose
of two feet diameter, over which the cable might
pass; and being there bent gradually to the round of
the wheel, would thereby be more equally strained, and
better able to bear the jerk, which may save the anchor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and by that means in the course of the voyage may
happen to save the ship.</p>

<p>One maritime observation more shall finish this letter.
I have been a reader of news-papers now near seventy
years, and I think few years pass without an account of
some vessel met with at sea, with no living soul on
board, and so many feet of water in her hold, which
vessel has nevertheless been saved and brought into
port: and when not met with at sea, such forsaken vessels
have often come ashore on some coast. The crews,
who have taken to their boats and thus abandoned such
vessels, are sometimes met with and taken up at sea by
other ships, sometimes reach a coast, and are sometimes
never heard of. Those that give an account of quitting
their vessels generally say, that she sprung a leak, that
they pumped for some time, that the water continued
to rise upon them, and that, despairing to save her, they
had quitted her lest they should go down with her. It
seems by the event that this fear was not always well
founded, and I have endeavoured to guess at the reason
of the people's too hasty discouragement.</p>

<p>When a vessel springs a leak near her bottom, the
water enters with all the force given by the weight of the
column of water, without, which force is in proportion
to the difference of level between the water without and
that within. It enters therefore with more force at
first and in greater quantity, than it can afterwards
when the water within is higher. The bottom of the
vessel too is narrower, so that the same quantity of water
coming into that narrow part, rises faster than when
the space for it to flow in is larger. This helps to terrify.
But as the quantity entering is less and less as
the surfaces without and within become more nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
equal in height, the pumps that could not keep the water
from rising at first, might afterwards be able to prevent
its rising higher, and the people might have remained
on board in safety, without hazarding themselves
in an open boat on the wide ocean.(Fig. 8.)</p>

<p>Besides the greater equality in the height of the two
surfaces, there may sometimes be other causes that retard
the farther sinking of a leaky vessel. The rising
water within may arrive at quantities of light wooden
work, empty chests, and particularly empty water-casks,
which if fixed so as not to float themselves may help to
sustain her. Many bodies which compose a ship's
cargo may be specifically lighter than water, all these
when out of water are an additional weight to that of
the ship, and she is in proportion pressed deeper into
the water; but as soon as these bodies are immersed,
they weigh no longer on the ship, but on the contrary,
if fixed, they help to support her, in proportion as they
are specifically lighter than the water. And it should
be remembered, that the largest body of a ship may be
so balanced in the water, that an ounce less or more of
weight may leave her at the surface or sink her to the
bottom. There are also certain heavy cargoes, that,
when the water gets at them, are continually dissolving,
and thereby lightening the vessel, such as salt and sugar.
And as to water-casks mentioned above, since the quantity
of them must be great in ships of war where the
number of men consume a great deal of water every
day, if it had been made a constant rule to bung them
up as fast as they were emptied, and to dispose the
empty casks in proper situations, I am persuaded that
many ships which have been sunk in engagements, or
have gone down afterwards, might with the unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
people have been saved; as well as many of those which
in the last war foundered, and were never heard of.
While on this topic of sinking, one cannot help recollecting
the well known practice of the Chinese, to divide
the hold of a great ship into a number of separate
chambers by partitions tight caulked (of which you
gave a model in your boat upon the Seine) so that if a
leak should spring in one of them the others are not affected
by it; and though that chamber should fill to a
level with the sea, it would not be sufficient to sink the
vessel. We have not imitated this practice. Some
little disadvantage it might occasion in the stowage is
perhaps one reason, though that I think might be more
than compensated by an abatement in the insurance
that would be reasonable, and by a higher price taken
of passengers, who would rather prefer going in such a
vessel. But our seafaring people are brave, despise
danger, and reject such precautions of safety, being
cowards only in one sense, that of <em>fearing</em> to be <em>thought
afraid</em>.</p>

<p>I promised to finish my letter with the last observation,
but the garrulity of the old man has got hold of
me, and as I may never have another occasion of writing
on this subject, I think I may as well now, once for
all, empty my nautical budget, and give you all the
thoughts that have in my various long voyages occurred
to me relating to navigation. I am sure that in you
they will meet with a candid judge, who will excuse
my mistakes on account of my good intention.</p>

<p>There are six accidents that may occasion the loss of
ships at sea. We have considered one of them, that
of foundering by a leak. The other five are, 1. Oversetting
by sudden flaws of wind, or by carrying sail be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>yond
the bearing. 2. Fire by accident or carelessness.
3. A heavy stroke of lightning, making a breach in the
ship, or firing the powder. 4. Meeting and shocking
with other ships in the night. 5. Meeting in the night
with islands of ice.</p>

<p>To that of oversetting, privateers in their first cruize
have, as far as has fallen within my knowledge or information,
been more subject than any other kind of
vessels. The double desire of being able to overtake a
weaker flying enemy, or to escape when pursued by a
stronger, has induced the owners to overmast their
cruizers, and to spread too much canvass; and the great
number of men, many of them not seamen, who being
upon deck when a ship heels suddenly are huddled
down to leeward, and increase by their weight the effect
of the wind. This therefore should be more attended
to and guarded against, especially as the advantage
of lofty masts is problematical. For the upper
sails have greater power to lay a vessel more on her side,
which is not the most advantageous position for going
swiftly through the water. And hence it is that vessels,
which have lost their lofty masts, and been able to make
little more sail afterwards than permitted the ship to
sail upon an even keel, have made so much way, even
under jury masts, as to surprize the mariners themselves.
But there is besides, something in the modern form of
our ships that seems as if calculated expressly to allow
their oversetting more easily. The sides of a ship, instead
of spreading out as they formerly did in the upper
works, are of late years turned in, so as to make the
body nearly round, and more resembling a cask. I do
not know what the advantages of this construction are,
except that such ships are not easily boarded. To me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
it seems a contrivance to have less room in a ship at
nearly the same expense. For it is evident that the
same timber and plank consumed in raising the sides
from a to b, and from d to c, would have raised
them from a to e, and from d to f, fig. 9. In this
form all the spaces between e, a, b, and c, d, f,
would have been gained, the deck would have been
larger, the men would have had more room to act, and
not have stood so thick in the way of the enemy's shot;
and the vessel, the more she was laid down on her side,
the more bearing she would meet with, and more effectual
to support her, as being farther from the centre.
Whereas in the present form, her ballast makes the
chief part of her bearing, without which she would turn
in the sea almost as easily as a barrel. More ballast by
this means becomes necessary, and that sinking a vessel
deeper in the water occasions more resistance to her
going through it. The Bermudian sloops still keep with
advantage to the old spreading form. The islanders in
the great Pacific ocean, though they have no large ships,
are the most expert boat-sailors in the world, navigating
that sea safely with their proas, which they prevent
oversetting by various means. Their sailing proas for
this purpose have outriggers generally to windward,
above the water, on which, one or more men are placed,
to move occasionally further from or nearer to the vessel
as the wind freshens or slackens. But some have
their outriggers to leeward, which, resting on the water,
support the boat so as to keep her upright when pressed
down by the wind. Their boats moved by oars or rather
by paddles are, for long voyages, fixed two together
by cross bars of wood that keep them at some distance
from each other, and so render their oversetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
next to impossible. How far this may be practicable
in larger vessels, we have not yet sufficient experience.
I know of but one trial made in Europe, which was
about one hundred years since, by Sir William Petty.
He built a double vessel, to serve as a packet boat between
England and Ireland. Her model still exists in
the museum of the Royal Society, where I have seen it.
By the accounts we have of her, she answered well the
purpose of her construction, making several voyages;
and though wrecked at last by a storm, the misfortune
did not appear owing to her particular construction,
since many other vessels of the common form were
wrecked at the same time. The advantage of such a
vessel is, that she needs no ballast, therefore swims
either lighter or will carry more goods; and that passengers
are not so much incommoded by her rolling:
to which may be added, that if she is to defend herself
by her cannon, they will probably have more effect,
being kept more generally in a horizontal position, than
those in common vessels. I think, however, that it
would be an improvement of that model, to make the
sides which are opposed to each other perfectly parallel,
though the other sides are formed as in common
thus, figure 10.</p>

<p>The building of a double ship would indeed be more
expensive in proportion to her burthen; and that perhaps
is sufficient to discourage the method.</p>

<p>The accident of fire is generally well guarded against
by the prudent captain's strict orders against smoking
between decks, or carrying a candle there out of a lanthorn.
But there is one dangerous practice which frequent
terrible accidents have not yet been sufficient to
abolish; that of carrying store-spirits to sea in casks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Two large ships, the Seraphis and the Duke of Athol,
one an East-Indiaman, the other a frigate, have been
burnt within these two last years, and many lives miserably
destroyed, by drawing spirits out of a cask
near a candle. It is high time to make it a general
rule, that all the ship's store of spirits should be carried
in bottles.</p>

<p>The misfortune by a stroke of lightning I have in
my former writings endeavoured to show a method of
guarding against, by a chain and pointed rod, extending,
when run up, from above the top of the mast to
the sea. These instruments are now made and sold at
a reasonable price by Nairne &amp; Co. in London, and
there are several instances of success attending the use
of them. They are kept in a box, and may be ran up
and fixed in about five minutes, on the apparent approach
of a thunder gust.</p>

<p>Of the meeting and shocking with other ships in the
night, I have known two instances in voyages between
London and America. In one both ships arrived though
much damaged, each reporting their belief that the
other must have gone to the bottom. In the other,
only one got to port; the other was never afterwards
heard of. These instances happened many years ago,
when the commerce between Europe and America was
not a tenth part of what it is at present, ships of course
thinner scattered, and the chance of meeting proportionably
less. It has long been the practice to keep a
<em>look-out before</em> in the channel, but at sea it has been
neglected. If it is not at present thought worth while
to take that precaution, it will in time become of more
consequence; since the number of ships at sea is continually
augmenting. A drum frequently beat, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
bell rung in a dark night, might help to prevent such
accidents.</p>

<p>Islands of ice are frequently seen off the banks of
Newfoundland, by ships going between North-America
and Europe. In the day time they are easily avoided,
unless in a very thick fog. I remember two instances
of ship's running against them in the night. The first
lost her bowsprit, but received little other damage.
The other struck where the warmth of the sea had
wasted the ice next to it, and a part hung over above.
This perhaps saved her, for she was under great way;
but the upper part of the cliff taking her foretopmast,
broke the shock, though it carried away the mast.
She disengaged herself with some difficulty, and got
safe into port; but the accident shows the possibility
of other ships being wrecked and sunk by striking those
vast masses of ice, of which I have seen one that we
judged to be seventy feet high above the water, consequently
eight times as much under water; and it is
another reason for keeping a good <em>look-out before</em>,
though far from any coast that may threaten danger.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that the people we consider as savages
have improved the art of sailing and rowing-boats
in several points beyond what we can pretend to.
We have no sailing-boats equal to the flying proas of
of the South Seas, no rowing or paddling-boat equal
to that of the Greenlanders for swiftness and safety.
The birch canoes of the North-American Indians have
also some advantageous properties. They are so light
that two men may carry one of them over land, which
is capable of carrying a dozen upon the water; and in
heeling they are not so subject to take in water as
our boats, the sides of which are lowest in the mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>dle
where it is most likely to enter, this being highest
in that part, as in figure 11.</p>

<p>The Chinese are an enlightened people, the most
antiently civilized of any existing, and their arts are antient,
a presumption in their favour: their method of
rowing their boats differs from ours, the oars being
worked either two a-stern as we scull, or on the sides
with the same kind of motion, being hung parallel to
the keel on a rail and always acting in the water, not
perpendicular to the side as ours are, nor lifted out at
every stroke, which is a loss of time, and the boat in
the interval loses motion. They see our manner, and
we theirs, but neither are disposed to learn of or copy
the other.</p>

<p>To the several means of moving boats mentioned
above, may be added the singular one lately exhibited
at Javelle, on the Seine below Paris, where a clumsy
boat was moved across that river in three minutes by
rowing, not in the water, but in the air, that is, by
whirling round a set of windmill vanes fixed to a horizontal
axis, parallel to the keel, and placed at the head
of the boat. The axis was bent into an elbow at the
end, by the help of which it was turned by one man
at a time. I saw the operation at a distance. The four
vanes appeared to be about five feet long, and perhaps
two and a half wide. The weather was calm. The labour
appeared to be great for one man, as the two several
times relieved each other. But the action upon
the air by the oblique surfaces of the vanes must have
been considerable, as the motion of the boat appeared
tolerably quick going and returning; and she returned
to the same place from whence she first set out, notwithstanding
the current. This machine is since ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>plied
to the moving of air-balloons: an instrument similar
may be contrived to move a boat by turning under
water.</p>

<p>Several mechanical projectors have at different times
proposed to give motion to boats, and even to ships,
by means of circular rowing, or paddles placed on the
circumference of wheels to be turned constantly on
each side of the vessel; but this method, though frequently
tried, has never been found so effectual as to
encourage a continuance of the practice. I do not
know that the reason has hitherto been given. Perhaps
it may be this, that great part of the force employed
contributes little to the motion. For instance,
(fig. 12) of the four paddles a, b, c, d, all under water,
and turning to move a boat from X to Y, c has the
most power, b nearly though not quite as much, their
motion being nearly horizontal; but the force employed
in moving a, is consumed in pressing almost downright
upon the water till it comes to the place of b; and the
force employed in moving d is consumed in lifting the
water till d arrives at the surface; by which means
much of the labour is lost. It is true, that by placing
the wheels higher out of the water, this waste labour
will be diminished in a calm, but where a sea runs, the
wheels must unavoidably be often dipt deep in the
waves, and the turning of them thereby rendered very
laborious to little purpose.</p>

<p>Among the various means of giving motion to a
boat, that of M. Bernoulli appears one of the most
singular, which was to have fixed in the boat a tube in
the form of an L, the upright part to have a funnel-kind
of opening at top, convenient for filling the tube
with water; which, descending and passing through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
lower horizontal part, and issuing in the middle of the
stern, but under the surface of the river, should push
the boat forward. There is no doubt that the force of
the descending water would have a considerable effect,
greater in proportion to the height from which it descended;
but then it is to be considered, that every
bucket-full pumped or dipped up into the boat, from
its side or through its bottom, must have its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertiæ</i>
overcome so as to receive the motion of the boat, before
it can come to give motion by its descent; and
that will be a deduction from the moving power. To
remedy this, I would propose the addition of another
such L pipe, and that they should stand back to
back in the boat thus, figure 13, the forward one
being worked as a pump, and sucking in the water at
the head of the boat, would draw it forward while
pushed in the same direction by the force at the stern.
And after all it should be calculated whether the labour
of pumping would be less than that of rowing. A fire-engine
might possibly in some cases be applied in this
operation with advantage.</p>

<p>Perhaps this labour of raising water might be spared,
and the whole force of a man applied to the moving of
a boat by the use of air instead of water; suppose the
boat constructed in this form, figure 14. A, a tube
round or square of two feet diameter, in which a piston
may move up and down. The piston to have valves in
it, opening inwards to admit air when the piston rises;
and shutting, when it is forced down by means of the
lever B turning on the centre C. The tube to have a
valve D, to open when the piston is forced down, and
let the air pass out at E, which striking forcibly against
the water abaft must push the boat forward. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
is added an air-vessel F properly valved and placed, the
force would continue to act while a fresh stroke is taken
with the lever. The boat-man might stand with his
back to the stern, and putting his hands behind him,
work the motion by taking hold of the cross bar at B,
while another should steer; or if he had two such
pumps, one on each side of the stern, with a lever for
each hand, he might steer himself by working occasionally
more or harder with either hand, as watermen
now do with a pair of sculls. There is no position in
which the body of a man can exert more strength than
in pulling right upwards. To obtain more swiftness,
greasing the bottom of a vessel is sometimes used, and
with good effect. I do not know that any writer has
hitherto attempted to explain this. At first sight
one would imagine, that though the friction of a hard
body, sliding on another hard body, and the resistance
occasioned by that friction, might be diminished by
putting grease between them, yet that a body sliding
on a fluid, such as water, should have no need of, nor
receive any advantage from such greasing. But the
fact is not disputed. And the reason perhaps may be
this&mdash;The particles of water have a mutual attraction,
called the attraction of adhesion. Water also adheres
to wood, and to many other substances, but not to
grease: on the contrary they have a mutual repulsion,
so that it is a question whether when oil is poured on
water, they ever actually touch each other; for a drop
of oil upon water, instead of sticking to the spot where
it falls, as it would if it fell on a looking-glass, spreads
instantly to an immense distance in a film extremely
thin, which it could not easily do if it touched and
rubbed or adhered even in a small degree to the sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>face
of the water. Now the adhesive force of water
to itself, and to other substances, may be estimated
from the weight of it necessary to separate a drop,
which adheres, while growing, till it has weight enough
to force the separation and break the drop off. Let us
suppose the drop to be the size of a pea, then there
will be as many of these adhesions as there are drops
of that size touching the bottom of a vessel, and these
must be broken by the moving power, every step of
her motion that amounts to a drop's breadth: and there
being no such adhesions to break between the water
and a greased bottom, may occasion the difference.</p>

<p>So much respecting the motion of vessels. But we
have sometimes occasion to stop their motion; and if a
bottom is near enough we can cast anchor: where there
are no soundings, we have as yet no means to prevent
driving in a storm, but by lying-to, which still permits
driving at the rate of about two miles an hour; so that
in a storm continuing fifty hours, which is not an uncommon
case, the ship may drive one hundred miles
out of her course; and should she in that distance
meet with a lee shore, she may be lost.</p>

<p>To prevent this driving to leeward in deep water, a
swimming anchor is wanting, which ought to have these
properties.</p>

<p>1. It should have a surface so large as, being at the
end of a hauser in the water, and placed perpendicularly,
should hold so much of it, as to bring the ship's
head to the wind, in which situation the wind has least
power to drive her.</p>

<p>2. It should be able by its resistance to prevent the
ship's receiving way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>3. It should be capable of being situated below the
heave of the sea, but not below the undertow.</p>

<p>4. It should not take up much room in the ship.</p>

<p>5. It should be easily thrown out, and put into its
proper situation.</p>

<p>6. It should be easy to take in again, and stow
away.</p>

<p>An ingenious old mariner, whom I formerly knew,
proposed, as a swimming anchor for a large ship, to have
a stem of wood twenty-five feet long and four inches
square, with four boards of 18, 16, 14, and 12, feet
long, and one foot wide, the boards to have their substance
thickened several inches in the middle by additional
wood, and to have each a four inch square hole
through its middle, to permit its being slipt on occasionally
upon the stem, and at right angles with it;
where all being placed and fixed at four feet distance
from each other, it would have the appearance of the
old mathematical instrument called a forestaff. This
thrown into the sea, and held by a hauser veered out
to some length, he conceived would bring a vessel up,
and prevent her driving, and when taken in might be
stowed away by separating the boards from the stem.
Figure 15. Probably such a swimming anchor would
have some good effect, but it is subject to this objection,
that lying on the surface of the sea, it is liable to
be hove forward by every wave, and thereby give so
much leave for the ship to drive.</p>

<p>Two machines for this purpose have occurred to me,
which, though not so simple as the above, I imagine
would be more effectual, and more easily manageable.
I will endeavour to describe them, that they may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
submitted to your judgment, whether either would be
serviceable; and if they would, to which we should
give the preference.</p>

<p>The first is to be formed, and to be used in the water
on almost the same principles with those of a paper
kite used in the air. Only as the paper kite rises in the
air, this is to descend in the water. Its dimensions
will be different for ships of different size.</p>

<p>To make one of suppose fifteen feet high; take a
small spar of that length for the back-bone, AB, figure
16, a smaller of half that length CD, for the cross
piece. Let these be united by a bolt at E, yet so as
that by turning on the bolt they may be laid parallel
to each other. Then make a sail of strong canvas, in
the shape of figure 17. To form this, without waste
of sail-cloth, sew together pieces of the proper length,
and for half the breadth, as in figure 18, then cut the
whole in the diagonal lines a, b, c, and turn the piece
F so as to place its broad part opposite to that of the
piece G, and the piece H in like manner opposite to I,
which when all sewed together will appear as in fig. 17.
This sail is to be extended on the cross of figure 16, the
top and bottom points well secured to the ends of the
long spar; the two side points d, e, fastened to the
ends of two cords, which coming from the angle of the
loop (which must be similar to the loop of a kite) pass
through two rings at the ends of the short spar, so as
that on pulling upon the loop the sail will be drawn to
its extent. The whole may, when aboard, be furled
up, as in figure 19, having a rope from its broad end,
to which is tied a bag of ballast for keeping that end
downwards when in the water, and at the other end
another rope with an empty keg at its end to float on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the surface; this rope long enough to permit the kite's
descending into the undertow, or if you please lower
into still water. It should be held by a hauser. To
get it home easily, a small loose rope may be veered
out with it, fixed to the keg. Hauling on that rope
will bring the kite home with small force, the resistance
being small as it will then come end ways.</p>

<p>It seems probable that such a kite at the end of a
long hauser would keep a ship with her head to the
wind, and, resisting every tug, would prevent her driving
so fast as when her side is exposed to it, and nothing
to hold her back. If only half the driving is
prevented, so as that she moves but fifty miles instead
of the hundred during a storm, it may be some advantage,
both in holding so much distance as is saved,
and in keeping from a lee-shore. If single canvas
should not be found strong enough to bear the tug
without splitting, it may be doubled, or strengthened
by a netting behind it, represented by figure 20.</p>

<p>The other machine for the same purpose, is to be
made more in the form of an umbrella, as represented,
figure 21. The stem of the umbrella a square spar of
proper length, with four moveable arms, of which two
are represented C, C, figure 22. These arms to be
fixed in four joint cleats, as D, D, &amp;c. one on each
side of the spar, but so as that the four arms may open
by turning on a pin in the joint. When open they
form a cross, on which a four-square canvas sail is to be
extended, its corners fastened to the ends of the four
arms. Those ends are also to be stayed by ropes fastened
to the stem or spar, so as to keep them short of
being at right angles with it: and to the end of one
of the arms should be hung the small bag of ballast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and to the end of the opposite arm the empty keg.
This, on being thrown into the sea, would immediately
open; and when it had performed its function, and the
storm over, a small rope from its other end being pulled
on, would turn it, close it, and draw it easily home
to the ship. This machine seems more simple in its
operation, and more easily manageable than the first,
and perhaps may be as effectual<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>Vessels are sometimes retarded, and sometimes forwarded
in their voyages, by currents at sea, which are
often not perceived. About the year 1769 or 70, there
was an application made by the board of customs at
Boston, to the lords of the treasury in London, complaining
that the packets between Falmouth and New-York,
were generally a fortnight longer in their passages,
than merchant-ships from London to Rhode-Island,
and proposing that for the future they should
be ordered to Rhode-Island instead of New-York.
Being then concerned in the management of the American
post-office, I happened to be consulted on the
occasion; and it appearing strange to me that there
should be such a difference between two places, scarce
a day's run asunder, especially when the merchant-ships
are generally deeper laden, and more weakly manned
than the packets, and had from London the whole
length of the river and channel to run before they left
the land of England, while the packets had only to go
from Falmouth, I could not but think the fact misunderstood
or misrepresented. There happened then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
be in London a Nantucket sea-captain of my acquaintance,
to whom I communicated the affair. He told
me he believed the fact might be true; but the difference
was owing to this, that the Rhode-Island captains
were acquainted with the gulf-stream, which those of
the English packets were not. We are well acquainted
with that stream, says he, because in our pursuit of
whales, which keep near the sides of it, but are not to
be met with in it, we run down along the sides, and
frequently cross it to change our side: and in crossing
it have sometimes met and spoke with those packets,
who were in the middle of it, and stemming it. We
have informed them that they were stemming a current,
that was against them to the value of three miles an
hour; and advised them to cross it and get out of it;
but they were too wise to be counselled by simple American
fishermen. When the winds are but light, he
added, they are carried back by the current more than
they are forwarded by the wind: and if the wind be
good, the subtraction of 70 miles a day from their
course is of some importance. I then observed it was
a pity no notice was taken of this current upon the
charts, and requested him to mark it out for me, which
he readily complied with, adding directions for avoiding
it in sailing from Europe to North-America. I
procured it to be engraved by order from the general
post-office, on the old chart of the Atlantic, at Mount
and Page's, Tower-hill; and copies were sent down to
Falmouth for the captains of the packets, who slighted
it however; but it is since printed in France, of which
edition I hereto annex a copy.</p>

<p>This stream is probably generated by the great accumulation
of water on the eastern coast of America be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>tween
the tropics, by the trade-winds which constantly
blow there. It is known that a large piece of water ten
miles broad and generally only three feet deep, has by
a strong wind had its waters driven to one side and sustained
so as to become six feet deep, while the windward
side was laid dry. This may give some idea of
the quantity heaped up on the American coast, and
the reason of its running down in a strong current
through the islands into the bay of Mexico, and from
thence issuing through the gulph of Florida, and proceeding
along the coast to the banks of Newfoundland,
where it turns off towards and runs down through the
Western Islands. Having since crossed this stream
several times in passing between America and Europe,
I have been attentive to sundry circumstances relating
to it, by which to know when one is in it; and besides
the gulph weed with which it is interspersed, I find that
it is always warmer than the sea on each side of it,
and that it does not sparkle in the night: I annex
hereto the observations made with the thermometer in
two voyages, and possibly may add a third. It will
appear from them, that the thermometer may be an
useful instrument to a navigator, since currents coming
from the northward into southern seas, will probably
be found colder than the water of those seas, as
the currents from southern seas into northern are found
warmer. And it is not to be wondered that so vast a
body of deep warm water, several leagues wide, coming
from between the tropics and issuing out of the
gulph into the northern seas, should retain its warmth
longer than the twenty or thirty days required to its
passing the banks of Newfoundland. The quantity is
too great, and it is too deep to be suddenly cooled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
passing under a cooler air. The air immediately over
it, however, may receive so much warmth from it as
to be rarefied and rise, being rendered lighter than the
air on each side of the stream; hence those airs must
flow in to supply the place of the rising warm air, and,
meeting with each other, form those tornados and
water-spouts frequently met with, and seen near and
over the stream; and as the vapour from a cup of tea
in a warm room, and the breath of an animal in the
same room, are hardly visible, but become sensible
immediately when out in the cold air, so the vapour
from the gulph stream, in warm latitudes is scarcely visible,
but when it comes into the cool air from Newfoundland,
it is condensed into the fogs, for which
those parts are so remarkable.</p>

<p>The power of wind to raise water above its common
level in the sea is known to us in America, by the high
tides occasioned in all our sea-ports when a strong
north-easter blows against the gulph stream.</p>

<p>The conclusion from these remarks is, that a vessel
from Europe to North-America may shorten her passage
by avoiding to stem the stream, in which the thermometer
will be very useful; and a vessel from America
to Europe may do the same by the same means of
keeping in it. It may have often happened accidentally,
that voyages have been shortened by these circumstances.
It is well to have the command of them.</p>

<p>But may there not be another cause, independent of
winds and currents, why passages are generally shorter
from America to Europe than from Europe to America?
This question I formerly considered in the following
short paper.</p>

<p>"This motion in a ship and cargo is of great force;
and if she could be lifted up suddenly from the harbour
in which she lay quiet, and set down instantly in the
latitude of the port she was bound to, though in a calm,
that force contained in her would make her run a great
way at a prodigious rate. This force must be lost gradually
in her voyage, by gradual impulse against the
water, and probably thence shorten the voyage. Query,
In returning does the contrary happen, and is her voyage
thereby retarded and lengthened?"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Would it not be a more secure method of planking
ships, if, instead of thick single planks laid horizontally,
we were to use planks of half the thickness, and lay
them double and across each other as in figure 23? To
me it seems that the difference of expence would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
considerable, and that the ship would be both tighter
and stronger.</p>

<p>The securing of the ship is not the only necessary
thing; securing the health of the sailors, a brave and
valuable order of men, is likewise of great importance.
With this view the methods so successfully practised
by Captain Cook in his long voyages cannot be too
closely studied or carefully imitated. A full account of
those methods is found in Sir John Pringle's speech,
when the medal of the Royal Society was given to that
illustrious navigator. I am glad to see in his last voyage
that he found the means effectual which I had proposed
for preserving flour, bread, &amp;c. from moisture
and damage. They were found dry and good after being
at sea four years. The method is described in my
printed works, page 452, fifth edition<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. In the same,
page 469, 470<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, is proposed a means of allaying thirst in
case of want of fresh water. This has since been practised
in two instances with success. Happy if their
hunger, when the other provisions are consumed, could
be relieved as commodiously; and perhaps in time this
may be found not impossible. An addition might be
made to their present vegetable provision, by drying
various roots in slices by the means of an oven. The
sweet potatoe of America and Spain is excellent for this
purpose. Other potatoes, with carrots, parsnips and
turnips, might be prepared and preserved in the same
manner.</p>

<p>With regard to make-shifts in cases of necessity, seamen
are generally very ingenious themselves. They
will excuse however the mention of two or three. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>they happen in any circumstance, such as after shipwreck,
taking to their boat, or the like, to want a compass,
a fine sewing-needle laid on clear water in a cup
will generally point to the north, most of them being a
little magnetical, or may be made so by being strongly
rubbed or hammered, lying in a north and south direction.
If their needle is too heavy to float by itself, it
may be supported by little pieces of cork or wood. A
man who can swim, may be aided in a long traverse by
his handkerchief formed into a kite, by two cross sticks
extending to the four corners; which, being raised in
the air when the wind is fair and fresh, will tow him
along while lying on his back. Where force is wanted
to move a heavy body, and there are but few hands
and no machines, a long and strong rope may make a
powerful instrument. Suppose a boat is to be drawn
up on a beach, that she may be out of the surf; a stake
drove into the beach where you would have the boat
drawn, and another to fasten the end of the rope to,
which comes from the boat, and then applying what
force you have to pull upon the middle of the rope at
right angles with it, the power will be augmented in
proportion to the length of rope between the posts.
The rope being fastened to the stake A, and drawn upon
in the direction C D, will slide over the stake B; and
when the rope is bent to the angle A D B, represented
by the pricked line in figure 24, the boat will be at B.</p>

<p>Some sailors may think the writer has given himself
unnecessary trouble in pretending to advise them; for
they have a little repugnance to the advice of landmen,
whom they esteem ignorant and incapable of giving
any worth notice; though it is certain that most of
their instruments were the invention of landmen. At
least the first vessel ever made to go on the water was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
certainly such. I will therefore add only a few words
more, and they shall be addressed to passengers.</p>

<p>When you intend a long voyage, you may do well
to keep your intention as much as possible a secret, or
at least the time of your departure; otherwise you will
be continually interrupted in your preparations by the
visits of friends and acquaintance, who will not only
rob you of the time you want, but put things out of
your mind, so that when you come to sea, you have the
mortification to recollect points of business that ought
to have been done, accounts you intended to settle,
and conveniencies you had proposed to bring with you,
&amp;c. &amp;c. all which have been omitted through the effect
of these officious friendly visits. Would it not be well
if this custom could be changed; if the voyager after
having, without interruption, made all his preparations,
should use some of the time he has left, in going himself
to take leave of his friends at their own houses, and
let them come to congratulate him on his happy return.</p>

<p>It is not always in your power to make a choice in
your captain, though much of your comfort in the passage
may depend on his personal character, as you must
for so long a time be confined to his company, and under
his direction; if he be a sensible, sociable, good-natured,
obliging man, you will be so much the happier.
Such there are; but if he happens to be otherwise,
and is only skilful, careful, watchful and active in
the conduct of his ship, excuse the rest, for these are
the essentials.</p>

<p>Whatever right you may have by agreement in the
mass of stores laid in by him for the passengers, it is
good to have some particular things in your own possession,
so as to be always at your own command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Good water, that of the ship being often bad.
You can be sure of having it good only by bottling it
from a clear spring or well and in clean bottles. 2. Good
tea. 3. Coffee ground. 4. Chocolate. 5. Wine of
the sort you particularly like, and cyder. 6. Raisins.
7. Almonds. 8. Sugar. 9. Capillaire. 10. Lemons.
11. Jamaica spirits. 12. Eggs greased. 13. Diet bread
14. Portable soup. 15. Rusks. As to fowls, it is not
worth while to have any called yours, unless you could
have the feeding and managing of them according to
your own judgment under your own eye. As they are
generally treated at present in ships, they are for the
most part sick, and their flesh tough and hard as whit-leather.
All seamen have an opinion, broached I supposed
at first prudently, for saving of water when short,
that fowls do not know when they have drank enough,
and will kill themselves if you give them too much, so
they are served with a little only once in two days.
This is poured into troughs that lie sloping, and therefore
immediately runs down to the lower end. There
the fowls ride upon one another's backs to get at it, and
some are not happy enough to reach and once dip their
bills in it. Thus tantalized, and tormented with thirst,
they cannot digest their dry food, they fret, pine, sicken
and die. Some are found dead, and thrown overboard
every morning, and those killed for the table are
not eatable. Their troughs should be in little divisions,
like cups, to hold the water separately, figure 25. But
this is never done. The sheep and hogs are therefore
your best dependance for fresh meat at sea, the mutton
being generally tolerable and the pork excellent.</p>

<p>It is possible your captain may have provided so well
in the general stores, as to render some of the particu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>lars
above recommended of little or no use to you. But
there are frequently in the ship poorer passengers, who
are taken at a lower price, lodge in the steerage, and
have no claim to any of the cabin provisions, or to any
but those kinds that are allowed the sailors. These people
are sometimes dejected, sometimes sick, there may
be women and children among them. In a situation
where there is no going to market, to purchase such necessaries,
a few of these your superfluities distributed
occasionally may be of great service, restore health,
save life, make the miserable happy, and thereby afford
you infinite pleasure.</p>

<p>The worst thing in ordinary merchant ships is the
cookery. They have no professed cook, and the worst
hand as a seaman is appointed to that office, in which
he is not only very ignorant but very dirty. The sailors
have therefore a saying, that <em>God sends meat and the devil
cooks</em>. Passengers more piously disposed, and willing
to believe heaven orders all things for the best, may
suppose, that, knowing the sea-air and constant exercise
by the motion of the vessel would give us extraordinary
appetites, bad cooks were kindly sent to prevent our
eating too much; or that, foreseeing we should have
bad cooks, good appetites were furnished to prevent
our starving. If you cannot trust to these circumstances,
a spirit-lamp, with a blaze-pan, may enable you
to cook some little things for yourself; such as a hash,
a soup, &amp;c. And it might be well also to have among
your stores some potted meats, which if well put up will
keep long good. A small tin oven, to place with the
open side before the fire, may be another good utensil,
in which your own servant may roast for you a bit of
pork or mutton. You will sometimes be induced to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the ship's salt beef, as it is often good. You will
find cyder the best quencher of that thirst which salt
meat or fish occasions. The ship biscuit is too hard for
some sets of teeth. It may be softened by toasting.
But rusk is better; for being made of good fermented
bread, sliced and baked a second time, the pieces imbibe
the water easily, soften immediately, digest more
kindly, and are therefore more wholesome than the unfermented
biscuit. By the way, rusk is the true original
biscuit, so prepared to keep for sea, biscuit in
French signifying twice baked. If your dry peas boil
hard, a two-pound iron shot put with them into the
pot, will by the motion of the ship grind them as fine
as mustard.</p>

<p>The accidents I have seen at sea with large dishes of
soup upon a table, from the motion of the ship, have
made me wish, that our potters or pewterers would make
soup-dishes in divisions, like a set of small bowls united
together, each containing about sufficient for one person,
in some such form as fig. 26; for then when the
ship should make a sudden heel, the soup would not in a
body flow over one side, and fall into people's laps and
scald them, as is sometimes the case, but would be retained
in the separate divisions, as in figure 27.</p>

<p>After these trifles, permit the addition of a few general
reflections. Navigation, when employed in supplying
necessary provisions to a country in want, and
thereby preventing famines, which were more frequent
and destructive before the invention of that art, is undoubtedly
a blessing to mankind. When employed
merely in transporting superfluities, it is a question
whether the advantage of the employment it affords is
equal to the mischief of hazarding so many lives on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
ocean. But when employed in pillaging merchants
and transporting slaves, it is clearly the means of augmenting
the mass of human misery. It is amazing to
think of the ships and lives risqued in fetching tea from
China, coffee from Arabia, sugar and tobacco from
America, all which our ancestors did well without.
Sugar employs near one thousand ships, tobacco almost
as many. For the utility of tobacco there is little to
be said; and for that of sugar, how much more commendable
would it be if we could give up the few minutes
gratification afforded once or twice a day by the
taste of sugar in our tea, rather than encourage the
cruelties exercised in producing it. An eminent French
moralist says, that when he considers the wars we excite
in Africa to obtain slaves, the numbers necessarily
slain in those wars, the many prisoners who perish at
sea by sickness, bad provisions, foul air, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the
transportation, and how many afterwards die from the
hardships of slavery, he cannot look on a piece of sugar
without conceiving it stained with spots of human
blood! Had he added the consideration of the wars we
make to take and retake the sugar islands from one another,
and the fleets and armies that perish in those
expeditions, he might have seen his sugar not merely
spotted, but <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'throughly'">thoroughly</ins> dyed scarlet in grain. It is
these wars that make the maritime powers of Europe,
the inhabitants of London and Paris, pay dearer for
sugar than those of Vienna, a thousand miles from the
sea; because their sugar costs not only the price they
pay for it by the pound, but all they pay in taxes to
maintain the fleets and armies that fight for it.</p>

New-York, in order to avoid the Gulph Stream on one
hand, and on the other the Shoals that lie to the Southward
of Nantucket and of St. George's Banks.</em></a></h3>

<p>After you have passed the banks of Newfoundland
in about the 44th degree of latitude, you will meet with
nothing, till you draw near the Isle of Sables, which
we commonly pass in latitude 43. Southward of this
isle, the current is found to extend itself as far north as
41° 20&#8242; or 30&#8242;, then it turns towards the E. S. E. or S. E. ¼ E.</p>

<p>Having passed the Isle of Sables, shape your course
for the St. George's Banks, so as to pass them in about
latitude 40°, because the current southward of those
banks reaches as far north as 39°. The shoals of those
banks lie in 41° 35&#8242;.</p>

<p>After having passed St. George's Banks, you must,
to clear Nantucket, form your course so as to pass between
the latitudes 38° 30&#8242; and 40° 45&#8242;.</p>

<p>The most southern part of the shoals of Nantucket lie
in about 40° 45&#8242;. The northern part of the current directly
to the south of Nantucket is felt in about latitude
38° 30&#8242;.</p>

<p>By observing these directions and keeping between
the stream and the shoals, the passage from the Banks
of Newfoundland to New-York, Delaware, or Virginia,
may be considerably shortened; for so you will have
the advantage of the eddy current, which moves contrary
to the Gulph Stream. Whereas if to avoid the
shoals you keep too far to the southward, and get into
that stream, you will be retarded by it at the rate of 60
or 70 miles a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nantucket whale-men being extremely well acquainted
with the Gulph Stream, its course, strength,
and extent, by their constant practice of whaling on the
edges of it, from their island quite down to the Bahamas,
this draft of that stream was obtained from one of
them, Captain Folges, and caused to be engraved on
the old chart in London, for the benefit of navigators,
by</p>

<p class="right padr2">B. FRANKLIN.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><em>Note</em>, The Nantucket captains who are acquainted with
this stream, make their voyages from England to
Boston in as short a time generally as others take in
going from Boston to England, viz. from twenty to
thirty days.</p>

<p>A stranger may know when he is in the Gulph Stream,
by the warmth of the water, which is much greater
than that of the water on each side of it. If then he
is bound to the westward, he should cross the stream
to get out of it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This day (10th) the thermometer still kept descending, and at five in
the morning of the 11th, it was in water as low as 70, when we struck
soundings. The same evening the pilot came on board, and we found
our ship about five degrees of longitude a-head of the reckoning, which
our captain accounted for by supposing our course to have been near the
edge of the gulph stream, and thus an eddy-current always in our favour.
By the distance we ran from Sept. 9, in the evening, till we struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> soundings,
we must have then been at the western edge of the gulph stream,
and the change in the temperature of the water was probably owing to
our suddenly passing from that current, into the waters of our own climate.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August the following experiment was made. The weather
being perfectly calm, an empty bottle, corked very tight, was sent
down 20 fathoms, and it was drawn up still empty. It was then sent
down again 35 fathoms, when the weight of the water having forced in
the cork, it was drawn up full; the water it contained was immediately
tried by the thermometer, and found to be 70, which was six degrees
colder than at the surface: the lead and bottle were visible, but not very
distinctly so, at the depth of 12 fathoms, but when only 7 fathoms deep,
they were perfectly seen from the ship. This experiment was thus repeated
Sept. 11, when we were in soundings of 18 fathoms. A keg was
previously prepared with a valve at each end, one opening inward, the
other outward; this was sent to the bottom in expectation that by the
valves being both open when going down, and both shut when coming
up, it would keep within it the water received at bottom. The upper
valve performed its office well, but the under one did not shut quite close,
so that much of the water was lost in hauling it up the ship's side. As
the water in the keg's passage upwards could not enter at the top, it was
concluded that what water remained in it was of that near the ground,
and on trying this by the thermometer, it was found to be at 58, which
was 12 degrees colder than at the surface.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Art of Swimming.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2">[No date.]</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I cannot be of opinion with you that it is too
late in life for you to learn to swim. The river near
the bottom of your garden affords a most convenient
place for the purpose. And as your new employment
requires your being often on the water, of which you
have such a dread, I think you would do well to make
the trial; nothing being so likely to remove those apprehensions
as the consciousness of an ability to swim
to the shore, in case of an accident, or of supporting
yourself in the water till a boat could come to take
you up.</p>

<p>I do not know how far corks or bladders may be useful
in learning to swim, having never seen much trial
of them. Possibly they may be of service in supporting
the body while you are learning what is called the
stroke, or that manner of drawing in and striking out
the hands and feet that is necessary to produce progressive
motion. But you will be no swimmer till you can
place some confidence in the power of the water to support
you; I would therefore advise the acquiring that
confidence in the first place; especially as I have known
several who, by a little of the practice necessary for
that purpose, have insensibly acquired the stroke, taught
as it were by nature.</p>

<p>The practice I mean is this. Chusing a place where
the water deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is
up to your breast, then turn round, your face to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
shore, and throw an egg into the water between you
and the shore. It will sink to the bottom, and be easily
seen there, as your water is clear. It must lie in water
so deep as that you cannot reach it to take it up but by
diving for it. To encourage yourself in order to do
this, reflect that your progress will be from deeper to
shallower water, and that at any time you may, by
bringing your legs under you and standing on the bottom,
raise your head far above the water. Then plunge
under it with your eyes open, throwing yourself towards
the egg, and endeavouring by the action of your hands
and feet against the water to get forward till within
reach of it. In this attempt you will find, that the water
buoys you up against your inclination; that it is not
so easy a thing to sink as you imagined; that you cannot
but by active force get down to the egg. Thus you
feel the power of the water to support you, and learn
to confide in that power; while your endeavours to
overcome it, and to reach the egg, teach you the manner
of acting on the water with your feet and hands,
which action is afterwards used in swimming to support
your head higher above water, or to go forward
through it.</p>

<p>I would the more earnestly press you to the trial of
this method, because, though I think I satisfied you
that your body is lighter than water, and that you
might float in it a long time with your mouth free for
breathing, if you would put yourself in a proper posture,
and would be still and forbear struggling; yet till you
have obtained this experimental confidence in the water,
I cannot depend on your having the necessary presence
of mind to recollect that posture and the directions
I gave you relating to it. The surprize may put
all out of your mind. For though we value ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
on being reasonable knowing creatures, reason and
knowledge seem on such occasions to be of little use to
us; and the brutes to whom we allow scarce a glimmering
of either, appear to have the advantage of us.</p>

<p>I will, however, take this opportunity of repeating,
those particulars to you, which I mentioned in our last
conversation, as, by perusing them at your leisure, you
may possibly imprint them so in your memory as on
occasion to be of some use to you.</p>

<p>1. That though the legs, arms, and head, of a human
body, being solid parts, are specifically something heavier
than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly the
upper part, from its hollowness, is so much lighter than
water, as that the whole of the body taken together is
too light to sink wholly under water, but some part will
remain above, until the lungs become filled with water,
which happens from drawing water into them instead
of air, when a person in the fright attempts breathing
while the mouth and nostrils are under water.</p>

<p>2. That the legs and arms are specifically lighter than
salt water, and will be supported by it, so that a human
body would not sink in salt-water, though the lungs
were filled as above, but from the greater specific gravity
of the head.</p>

<p>3. That therefore a person throwing himself on his
back in salt water, and extending his arms, may easily
lie so as to keep his mouth and nostrils free for breathing;
and by a small motion of his hands may prevent
turning, if he should perceive any tendency to it.</p>

<p>4. That in fresh water, if a man throws himself on his
back, near the surface, he cannot long continue in that
situation but by proper action of his hands on the water.
If he uses no such action, the legs and lower part
of the body will gradually sink till he comes into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
upright position, in which he will continue suspended,
the hollow of the breast keeping the head uppermost.</p>

<p>5. But if, in this erect position, the head is kept upright
above the shoulders, as when we stand on the
ground, the immersion will, by the weight of that part
of the head that is out of water, reach above the mouth
and nostrils, perhaps a little above the eyes, so that a
man cannot long remain suspended in water with his
head in that position.</p>

<p>6. The body continuing suspended as before, and upright,
if the head be leaned quite back, so that the face
looks upwards, all the back part of the head being then
under water, and its weight consequently in a great
measure supported by it, the face will remain above
water quite free for breathing, will rise an inch higher
every inspiration, and sink as much every expiration, but
never so low as that the water may come over the mouth.</p>

<p>7. If therefore a person unacquainted with swimming
and falling accidentally into the water, could have
presence of mind sufficient to avoid struggling and
plunging, and to let the body take this natural position,
he might continue long safe from drowning till perhaps
help would come. For as to the cloaths, their additional
weight while immersed is very inconsiderable, the
water supporting it though, when he comes out of the
water, he would find them very heavy indeed.</p>

<p>But, as I said before, I would not advise you or any
one to depend on having this presence of mind on such
an occasion, but learn fairly to swim; as I wish all men
were taught to do in their youth; they would, on many
occurrences, be the safer for having that skill, and on
many more the happier, as freer from painful apprehensions
of danger, to say nothing of the enjoyment in
so delightful and wholesome an exercise. Soldiers par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>ticularly
should, methinks, all be taught to swim; it
might be of frequent use either in surprising an enemy,
or saving themselves. And if I had now boys to educate,
I should prefer those schools (other things being
equal) where an opportunity was afforded for acquiring
so advantageous an art, which once learned is never
forgotten.</p>

<p>**** I am apprehensive that I shall not be able to
find leisure for making all the disquisitions and experiments
which would be desirable on this subject. I
must, therefore, content myself with a few remarks.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of some human bodies, in comparison
to that of water, has been examined by Mr.
Robinson, in our Philosophical Transactions, volume 50,
page 30, for the year 1757. He asserts, that fat persons
with small bones float most easily upon the water.</p>

<p>The diving-bell is accurately described in our Transactions.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, I made two oval pallets, each
about ten inches long, and six broad, with a hole for
the thumb, in order to retain it fast in the palm of my
hand. They much resembled a painter's pallets. In
swimming I pushed the edges of these forward, and I
struck the water with their flat surfaces as I drew them
back. I remember I swam faster by means of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
pallets, but they fatigued my wrists. I also fitted to the
soles of my feet a kind of sandals; but I was not satisfied
with them, because I observed that the stroke is
partly given by the inside of the feet and the ancles,
and not entirely with the soles of the feet.</p>

<p>We have here waistcoats for swimming, which are
made of double sail-cloth, with small pieces of cork
quilted in between them.</p>

<p>I know nothing of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">scaphandre</i> of M. de la Chapelle.</p>

<p>I know by experience, that it is a great comfort to a
swimmer, who has a considerable distance to go, to
turn himself sometimes on his back, and to vary in other
respects the means of procuring a progressive motion.</p>

<p>When he is seized with the cramp in the leg, the
method of driving it away is to give to the parts
affected a sudden, vigorous and violent shock; which
he may do in the air as he swims on his back.</p>

<p>During the great heats of summer there is no danger
in bathing, however warm we may be, in rivers which
have been thoroughly warmed by the sun. But to
throw oneself into cold spring water, when the body
has been heated by exercise in the sun, is an imprudence
which may prove fatal. I once knew an instance
of four young men, who, having worked at harvest in
the heat of the day, with a view of refreshing themselves
plunged into a spring of cold water: two died upon the
spot, a third the next morning, and the fourth recovered
with great difficulty. A copious draught of cold
water, in similar circumstances, is frequently attended
with the same effect in North America.</p>

<p>The exercise of swimming is one of the most healthy
and agreeable in the world. After having swam for an
hour or two in the evening, one sleeps coolly the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
night, even during the most ardent heat of summer.
Perhaps the pores being cleansed, the insensible perspiration
increases and occasions this coolness. It is certain
that much swimming is the means of stopping a diarrhœa,
and even of producing a constipation. With respect
to those who do not know how to swim, or who are
affected with a diarrhœa at a season which does not permit
them to use that exercise, a warm bath, by cleansing
and purifying the skin, is found very salutary, and
often effects a radical cure. I speak from my own experience,
frequently repeated, and that of others to
whom I have recommended this.</p>

<p>You will not be displeased if I conclude these hasty
remarks by informing you, that as the ordinary method
of swimming is reduced to the act of rowing with the
arms and legs, and is consequently a laborious and fatiguing
operation when the space of water to be crossed
is considerable; there is a method in which a swimmer
may pass to great distances with much facility, by
means of a sail. This discovery I fortunately made by
accident, and in the following manner.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I amused myself one day with
flying a paper kite; and approaching the bank of a
pond, which was near a mile broad, I tied the string to
a stake, and the kite ascended to a very considerable
height above the pond, while I was swimming. In a
little time, being desirous of amusing myself with my
kite, and enjoying at the same time the pleasure of
swimming, I returned; and loosing from the stake
the string with the little stick which was fastened
to it, went again into the water, where I found, that,
lying on my back and holding the stick in my hands, I
was drawn along the surface of the water in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
agreeable manner. Having then engaged another boy
to carry my clothes round the pond, to a place which I
pointed out to him on the other side, I began to cross
the pond with my kite, which carried me quite over
without the least fatigue, and with the greatest pleasure
imaginable. I was only obliged occasionally to halt a
little in my course, and resist its progress, when it appeared
that, by following too quick, I lowered the kite
too much; by doing which occasionally I made it rise
again. I have never since that time practised this
singular mode of swimming, though I think it not impossible
to cross in this manner from Dover to Calais.
The packet-boat, however, is still preferable. ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the free Use of Air.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, July 28, 1760.</em></p>

<p>**** I greatly approve the epithet which you
give, in your letter of the 8th of June, to the new method
of treating the small-pox, which you call the <em>tonic</em>
or bracing method; I will take occasion, from it, to
mention a practice to which I have accustomed myself.
You know the cold bath has long been in vogue here
as a tonic; but the shock of the cold water has always
appeared to me, generally speaking, as too violent, and
I have found it much more agreeable to my constitution
to bathe in another element, I mean cold air.
With this view I rise almost every morning, and sit in
my chamber without any clothes whatever, half an hour
or an hour, according to the season, either reading or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
writing. This practice is not in the least painful, but,
on the contrary, agreeable; and if I return to bed afterwards,
before I dress myself, as sometimes happens, I
make a supplement to my night's rest of one or two
hours of the most pleasing sleep that can be imagined.
I find no ill consequences whatever resulting from it,
and that at least it does not injure my health, if it does
not in fact contribute much to its preservation. I shall
therefore call it for the future a <em>bracing</em> or <em>tonic</em>
bath. ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Causes of Colds.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>March 10, 1773.</em></p>

<p>**** I shall not attempt to explain why damp clothes
occasion colds, rather than wet ones, because I doubt
the fact; I imagine that neither the one nor the other
contribute to this effect, and that the causes of colds
are totally independent of wet and even of cold. I propose
writing a short paper on this subject, the first moment
of leisure I have at my disposal. In the mean
time I can only say, that having some suspicions that
the common notion, which attributes to cold the property
of stopping the pores and obstructing perspiration,
was ill founded, I engaged a young physician, who
is making some experiments with Sanctorius's balance,
to estimate the different proportions of his perspiration,
when remaining one hour quite naked, and another
warmly clothed. He pursued the experiment in this
alternate manner for eight hours successively, and
found his perspiration almost double during those hours
in which he was naked. ****</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>This comes to you on account of Dr. Douglass: he
desired me to write to you for what you know of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>number that died of the inoculation in Philadelphia,
telling me he designed to write something on the small-pox
shortly. We shall both be obliged to you for a
word on this affair.</p>

<p>The chief particulars of our visitation, you have in
the public prints. But the less degree of mortality than
usual in the common way of infection, seems chiefly
owing to the purging method designed to prevent the
secondary fever; a method first begun and carried on
in this town, and with success beyond expectation.
We lost one in eleven one-sixth, but had we been
experienced in this way, at the first coming of the distemper,
probably the proportion had been but one in
thirteen or fourteen. In the year 1730 we lost one
in nine, which is more favourable than ever before with
us. The distemper pretty much the same then as now,
but some circumstances not so kind this time.</p>

<p>If there be any particulars which you want to know,
please to signify what they are, and I shall send them.</p>

<p>The number of our inhabitants decreases<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. On a
strict inquiry, the overseers of the poor find but fourteen
thousand one hundred and ninety Whites, and
one thousand five hundred and forty-four Blacks, including
those absent, on account of the small-pox,
many of whom, it is probable, will never return.</p>

<p>I pass this opportunity without any particulars of my
old theme. One thing, however, I must mention,
which is, that perhaps my last letters contained something
that seemed to militate with your doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<em>Origin</em>, &amp;c. But my design was only to relate the phenomena
as they appeared to me. I have received so
much light and pleasure from your writings, as to prejudice
me in favour of every thing from your hand, and
leave me only liberty to observe, and a power of dissenting
when some great probability might oblige me:
and if at any time that be the case, you will certainly
hear of it.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>In Answer to the preceding.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Aug. 13, 1752.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>I received your favour of the 3d instant. Some
time last winter I procured from one of our physicians
an account of the number of persons inoculated during
the five visitations of the small-pox we have had in
twenty-two years; which account I sent to Mr. W. V.
of your town, and have no copy. If I remember right,
the number exceeded eight hundred, and the deaths
were but four. I suppose Mr. V. will show you the account,
if he ever received it. Those four were all that
our doctors allow to have died of the small-pox by inoculation,
though I think there were two more of the
inoculated who died of the distemper; but the eruptions
appearing soon after the operation, it is supposed they
had taken the infection before, in the common way.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to see what Dr. Douglass may write
on the subject. I have a French piece printed at Paris,

with the particulars of your purging method, to prevent

<p>I am indebted for your preceding letter, but business
sometimes obliges one to postpone philosophical amusements.
Whatever I have wrote of that kind, are really,
as they are entitled, but <em>Conjectures</em> and <em>Suppositions</em>;
which ought always to give place, when careful observation
militates against them. I own I have too strong
a penchant to the building of hypotheses; they indulge
my natural indolence: I wish I had more of your patience
and accuracy in making observations, on which,
alone, true philosophy can be founded. And, I assure
you, nothing can be more obliging to me, than your
kind communication of those you make, however they
may disagree with my pre-conceived notions.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that the number of your inhabitants
decreases. I some time since, wrote a small

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Effects of Lead upon the human Constitution.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, July 31, 1786.</em></p>

<p class="fs60 pad2">DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>I recollect that when I had last the pleasure
of seeing you at Southampton, now a twelvemonth
since, we had some conversation on the bad effects of
lead taken inwardly; and that at your request I promised
to send you in writing a particular account of
several facts I then mentioned to you, of which you
thought some good use might be made. I now sit
down to fulfil that promise.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember of this kind was a general
discourse in Boston when I was a boy, of a complaint
from North Carolina against New-England rum,
that it poisoned their people, giving them the dry-belly-ach,
with a loss of the use of their limbs. The
distilleries being examined on the occasion, it was
found, that several of them used leaden still-heads and
worms, and the physicians were of opinion, that the
mischief was occasioned by that use of lead. The legislature
of Massachussetts thereupon passed an act,
prohibiting, under severe penalties, the use of such
still-heads and worms hereafter.</p>

<p>In 1724, being in London, I went to work in the
printing-house of Mr. Palmer, Bartholomew-close, as
a compositor. I there found a practice, I had never
seen before, of drying a case of types (which are wet
in distribution) by placing it sloping before the fire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
I found this had the additional advantage, when the
types were not only dried but heated, of being comfortable
to the hands working over them in cold weather.
I therefore sometimes heated my case when the
types did not want drying. But an old workman observing
it advised me not to do so, telling me I might
lose the use of my hands by it, as two of our companions
had nearly done, one of whom, that used to earn his
guinea a week, could not then make more than ten
shillings, and the other, who had the dangles, but seven
and sixpence. This, with a kind of obscure pain,
that I had sometimes felt, as it were, in the bones of
my hand when working over the types made very hot,
induced me to omit the practice. But talking afterwards
with Mr. James, a letter-founder in the same
Close, and asking him if his people, who worked over
the little furnaces of melted metal, were not subject to
that disorder; he made light of any danger from the
effluvia, but ascribed it to particles of the metal swallowed
with their food by slovenly workmen, who went
to their meals after handling the metal, without well
washing their fingers, so that some of the metalline
particles were taken off by their bread and eaten with
it. This appeared to have some reason in it. But the
pain I had experienced made me still afraid of those
effluvia.</p>

<p>Being in Derbyshire at some of the furnaces for smelting
of lead ore, I was told, that the smoke of those
furnaces was pernicious to the neighbouring grass and
other vegetables; but I do not recollect to have heard
any thing of the effect of such vegetables eaten by
animals. It may be well to make the enquiry.</p>

<p>In America I have often observed, that on the roofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of our shingled-houses, where moss is apt to grow in
northern exposures, if there be any thing on the roof
painted with white lead, such as balusters, or frames
of dormant windows, &amp;c. there is constantly a streak
on the shingles from such paint down to the eaves, on
which no moss will grow, but the wood remains constantly
clean and free from it. We seldom drink rain-water
that fall on our houses; and if we did, perhaps
the small quantity of lead descending from such paint
might not be sufficient to produce any sensible ill-effect
on our bodies. But I have been told of a case
in Europe, I forget the place, where a whole family
was afflicted with what we call the dry-belly-ach, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colica pictorum</i>, by drinking rain-water. It was at a
country-seat, which, being situated too high to have
the advantage of a well, was supplied with water from
a tank, which received the water from the leaded roofs.
This had been drank several years without mischief,
but some young trees planted near the house growing
up above the roof, and shedding their leaves upon it,
it was supposed, that an acid in those leaves had
corroded the lead they covered, and furnished the water
of that year with its baneful particles and qualities.</p>

<p>When I was in Paris with Sir John Pringle in 1767,
he visited <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Charité</i>, an hospital particularly famous
for the cure of that malady, and brought from thence
a pamphlet, containing a list of the names of persons,
specifying their professions or trades, who had been
cured there. I had the curiosity to examine that list,
and found, that all the patients were of trades, that
some way or other use or work in lead; such as plumbers,
glaziers, painters, &amp;c. excepting only two kinds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
stone-cutters and soldiers. In them, I could not reconcile
it to my notion, that lead was the cause of that
disorder. But on my mentioning it to a physician of
that hospital, he informed me, that the stone-cutters
are continually using melted lead to fix the ends of
iron balustrades in stone; and that the soldiers had
been employed by painters as labourers in grinding of
colours.</p>

<p>This, my dear friend, is all I can at present recollect
on the subject. You will see by it, that the opinion
of this mischievous effect from lead, is at least
above sixty years old; and you will observe with concern
how long a useful truth may be known and exist,
before it is generally received and practised on.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Observations on the prevailing Doctrines of Life and Death.</em></a></h3>

<p>**** Your observations on the causes of death,
and the experiments which you propose for recalling to
life those who appear to be killed by lightning, demonstrate
equally your sagacity and your humanity. It
appears, that the doctrines of life and death, in general,
are yet but little understood.</p>

<p>A toad buried in sand will live, it is said, till the
sand becomes petrified: and then, being inclosed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the stone, it may still live for we know not how many
ages. The facts which are cited in support of this opinion
are too numerous, and too circumstantial, not to
deserve a certain degree of credit. As we are accustomed
to see all the animals, with which we are acquainted,
eat and drink, it appears to us difficult to
conceive, how a toad can be supported in such a dungeon:
but if we reflect, that the necessity of nourishment,
which animals experience in their ordinary state,
proceeds from the continual waste of their substance
by perspiration, it will appear less incredible, that some
animals in a torpid state, perspiring less because they
use no exercise, should have less need of aliment; and
that others, which are covered with scales or shells,
which stop perspiration, such as land and sea-turtles,
serpents, and some species of fish, should be able to
subsist a considerable time without any nourishment
whatever.&mdash;A plant, with its flowers, fades and dies
immediately, if exposed to the air without having its
root immersed in a humid soil, from which it may
draw a sufficient quantity of moisture to supply that
which exhales from its substance and is carried off continually
by the air. Perhaps, however, if it were buried
in quicksilver, it might preserve for a considerable
space of time its vegetable life, its smell and colour.
If this be the case, it might prove a commodious method
of transporting from distant countries those delicate
plants, which are unable to sustain the inclemency
of the weather at sea, and which require particular
care and attention. I have seen an instance of common
flies preserved in a manner somewhat similar.
They had been drowned in Madeira wine, apparently
about the time when it was bottled in Virginia, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
sent hither (to London). At the opening of one of the
bottles, at the house of a friend where I then was, three
drowned flies fell into the first glass that was filled.
Having heard it remarked, that drowned flies were capable
of being revived by the rays of the sun, I proposed
making the experiment upon these: they were
therefore exposed to the sun upon a sieve, which had
been employed to strain them out of the wine. In less
than three hours, two of them began by degrees to recover
life. They commenced by some convulsive motions
of the thighs, and at length they raised themselves
upon their legs, wiped their eyes with their fore-feet,
beat and brushed their wings with their hind-feet,
and soon after began to fly, finding themselves in Old
England, without knowing how they came thither.
The third continued lifeless till sunset, when, losing all
hopes of him, he was thrown away.</p>

<p>I wish it were possible, from this instance, to invent
a method of embalming drowned persons, in such a
manner that they may be recalled to life at any period,
however distant; for having a very ardent desire to see
and observe the state of America an hundred years
hence, I should prefer to any ordinary death, the being
immersed in a cask of Madeira wine, with a few friends
till that time, to be then recalled to life by the solar
warmth of my dear country! But since in all probability
we live in an age too early and too near the infancy
of science, to hope to see such an art brought in our
time to its perfection, I must for the present content
myself with the treat, which you are so kind as to promise
me, of the resurrection of a fowl or a turkey-cock.</p>

<p class="pfs70"><br />BY B. FRANKLIN.</p>

<p class="pfs80">(First printed at Philadelphia in 1745.)</p>

<p>In these northern colonies the inhabitants keep fires
to sit by generally seven months in the year; that is,
from the beginning of October, to the end of April;
and, in some winters, near eight months, by taking in
part of September and May.</p>

<p>Wood, our common fuel, which within these hundred
years might be had at every man's door, must
now be fetched near one hundred miles to some towns,
and makes a very considerable article in the expence
of families.</p>

<p>As therefore so much of the comfort and conveniency
of our lives, for so great a part of the year, depends
on the article of <em>fire</em>; since fuel is become so
expensive, and (as the country is more cleared and settled)
will of course grow scarcer and dearer, any new
proposal for saving the wood, and for lessening the
charge, and augmenting the benefit of fire, by some
particular method of making and managing it, may at
least be thought worth consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The new fire-places are a late invention to that purpose,
of which this paper is intended to give a particular
account.</p>

<p>That the reader may the better judge whether this
method of managing fire has any advantage over those
heretofore in use, it may be proper to consider both the
old and new methods separately and particularly, and
afterwards make the comparison.</p>

<p>In order to this, it is necessary to understand well,
some few of the properties of air and fire, viz.</p>

<p>1. Air is rarefied by <em>heat</em>, and condensed by <em>cold</em>, <em>i. e.</em>
the same quantity of air takes up more space when
warm than when cold. This may be shown by several
very easy experiments. Take any clear glass bottle
(a Florence flask stript of the straw is best) place it before
the fire, and as the air within is warmed and rarefied,
part of it will be driven out of the bottle; turn it
up, place its mouth in a vessel of water, and remove
it from the fire; then, as the air within cools and contracts,
you will see the water rise in the neck of the
bottle, supplying the place of just so much air as was
driven out. Hold a large hot coal near the side of the
bottle, and as the air within feels the heat, it will again
distend and force out the water.&mdash;Or, fill a bladder not
quite full of air, tie the neck tight, and lay it before
a fire as near as may be without scorching the bladder;
as the air within heats, you will perceive it to swell
and fill the bladder, till it becomes tight, as if full
blown: remove it to a cool place, and you will see it
fall gradually, till it becomes as lank as at first.</p>

<p>2. Air rarefied and distended by heat is<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> specifically</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>lighter than it was before, and will rise in other air of
greater density. As wood, oil, or any other matter
specifically lighter than water, if placed at the bottom
of a vessel of water, will rise till it comes to the top;
so rarefied air will rise in common air, till it either
comes to air of equal weight, or is by cold reduced to
its former density.</p>

<p>A fire then being made in any chimney, the air over
the fire is rarefied by the heat, becomes lighter, and
therefore immediately rises in the funnel, and goes out;
the other air in the room (flowing towards the chimney)
supplies its place, is rarefied in its turn, and rises
likewise; the place of the air thus carried out of the
room, is supplied by fresh air coming in through doors
and windows, or, if they be shut, through every crevice
with violence, as may be seen by holding a candle
to a key-hole: If the room be so tight as that all the
crevices together will not supply so much air as is continually
carried off, then, in a little time, the current
up the funnel must flag, and the smoke being no longer
driven up, must come into the room.</p>

<p>1. Fire (<em>i. e.</em> common fire) throws out light, heat,
and smoke (or fume.) The two first move in right
lines, and with great swiftness, the latter is but just
separated from the fuel, and then moves only as it is
carried by the stream of rarefied air: and without a
continual accession and recession of air, to carry off
the smoaky fumes, they would remain crouded about
the fire, and stifle it.</p>

<p>2. Heat may <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'he separated'">be separated</ins> from the smoke as well as
from the light, by means of a plate of iron, which will
suffer heat to pass through it without the others.</p>

<p>3. Fire sends out its rays of heat as well as rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
light, equally every way; but the greatest sensible heat
is over the fire, where there is, besides the rays of heat
shot upwards, a continual rising stream of hot air, heated
by the rays shot round on every side.</p>

<p>These things being understood, we proceed to consider
the fire-places heretofore in use, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>1. The large open fire-places used in the days of our
fathers, and still generally in the country, and in kitchens.</p>

<p>2. The newer-fashioned fire-places, with low breasts,
and narrow hearths.</p>

<p>3. Fire-places with hollow backs, hearths, and jams
of iron (described by M. Gauger, in his tract entitled,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Mechanique de Feu</cite>) for warming the air as it comes
into the room.</p>

<p>4. The Holland stoves, with iron doors opening into
the room.</p>

<p>5. The German stoves, which have no opening in
the room where they are used, but the fire is put in
from some other room, or from without.</p>

<p>6. Iron pots, with open charcoal fires, placed in the
middle of a room.</p>

<p>1. The first of these methods has generally the conveniency
of two warm seats, one in each corner; but
they are sometimes too hot to abide in, and, at other
times, incommoded with the smoke; there is likewise
good room for the cook to move, to hang on pots, &amp;c.
Their inconveniencies are, that they almost always
smoke, if the door be not left open; that they require
a large funnel, and a large funnel carries off a great
quantity of air, which occasions what is called a strong
draft to the chimney, without which strong draft the
smoke would come out of some part or other of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
large an opening, so that the door can seldom be shut;
and the cold air so nips the backs and heels of those
that sit before the fire, that they have no comfort till
either screens or settles are provided (at a considerable
expence) to keep it off, which both cumber the room,
and darken the fire-side. A moderate quantity of wood
on the fire, in so large a hearth, seems but little; and,
in so strong and cold a draught, warms but little; so
that people are continually laying on more. In short,
it is next to impossible to warm a room with such a
fire-place: and I suppose our ancestors never thought
of warming rooms to sit in; all they purposed was, to
have a place to make a fire in, by which they might
warm themselves when cold.</p>

<p>2. Most of these old-fashioned chimneys in towns
and cities, have been, of late years, reduced to the second
sort mentioned, by building jambs within them,
narrowing the hearth, and making a low arch or breast.
It is strange, methinks, that though chimneys have been
so long in use, their construction should be so little understood
till lately, that no workman pretended to make
one which should always carry off all smoke, but a
chimney-cloth was looked upon as essential to a chimney.
This improvement, however, by small openings
and low breasts, has been made in our days; and success
in the first experiments has brought it into general
use in cities, so that almost all new chimneys are now
made of that sort, and much fewer bricks will make a
stack of chimneys now than formerly. An improvement,
so lately made, may give us room to believe, that
still farther improvements may be found to remedy the
inconveniencies yet remaining. For these new chimneys,
though they keep rooms generally free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
smoke, and, the opening being contracted, will allow
the door to be shut, yet the funnel still requiring a considerable
quantity of air, it rushes in at every crevice
so strongly, as to make a continual whistling or howling;
and it is very uncomfortable, as well as dangerous,
to sit against any such crevice. Many colds are
caught from this cause only, it being safer to sit in the
open street, for then the pores do all close together,
and the air does not strike so sharply against any particular
part of the body.</p>

<p>The Spaniards have a proverbial saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">If the wind blows on you through a hole,</p>
<p class="verse">Make your will, and take care of your soul.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Women particularly, from this cause, as they sit much
in the house, get colds in the head, rheums and defluctions,
which fall into their jaws and gums, and have
destroyed early many a fine set of teeth in these northern
colonies. Great and bright fires do also very much
contribute to damage the eyes, dry and shrivel the skin,
and bring on early the appearances of old age. In
short, many of the diseases proceeding from colds, as
fevers, pleurisies, &amp;c. fatal to very great numbers of
people, may be ascribed to strong drawing chimneys,
whereby, in severe weather, a man is scorched before
while he is froze behind.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In the mean time, very little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>is done by these chimneys towards warming the
room; for the air round the fire-place, which is warmed
by the direct rays from the fire, does not continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in the room, but is continually crouded and gathered
into the chimney by the current of cold air coming behind
it, and so is presently carried off.</p>

<p>In both these sorts of fire-places, the greatest part of
the heat from the fire is lost; for as fire naturally darts
heat every way, the back, the two jambs, and the hearth,
drink up almost all that is given them, very little being
reflected from bodies so dark, porous, and unpolished;
and the upright heat, which is by far the greatest, flies
directly up the chimney. Thus five-sixths at least of
the heat (and consequently of the fuel) is wasted, and
contributes nothing towards warming the room.</p>

<p>3. To remedy this, the Sieur Gauger gives, in his
book entitled, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Mechanique de Feu</span>, published in
1709, seven different constructions of the third sort of
chimneys mentioned above, in which there are hollow
cavities made by iron plates in the back, jambs, and
hearths, through which plates the heat passing warms
the air in those cavities, which is continually coming
into the room fresh and warm. The invention was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ingenious, and had many conveniencies: the room was
warmed in all parts, by the air flowing into it through
the heated cavities: cold air was prevented rushing
through the crevices, the funnel being sufficiently supplied
by those cavities: much less fuel would serve, &amp;c.
But the first expence, which was very great, the intricacy
of the design, and the difficulty of the execution,
especially in old chimneys, discouraged the propagation
of the invention; so that there are, I suppose, very few
such chimneys now in use. [The upright heat, too,
was almost all lost in these, as in the common chimneys.]</p>

<p>4. The Holland iron stove, which has a flue proceeding
from the top, and a small iron door opening into
the room, comes next to be considered. Its conveniencies
are, that it makes a room all over warm; for
the chimney being wholly closed, except the flue of the
stove, very little air is required to supply that, and
therefore not much rushes in at crevices, or at the door
when it is opened. Little fuel serves, the heat being
almost all saved; for it rays out almost equally from the
four sides, the bottom and the top, into the room, and
presently warms the air around it, which, being rarefied,
rises to the ceiling, and its place is supplied by the
lower air of the room, which flows gradually towards
the stove, and is there warmed, and rises in its turn, so
that there is a continual circulation till all the air in the
room is warmed. The air, too, is gradually changed,
by the stove-door's being in the room, through which
part of it is continually passing, and that makes these
stoves wholesomer, or at least pleasanter than the German
stoves, next to be spoken of. But they have these
inconveniencies. There is no sight of the fire, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in itself a pleasant thing. One cannot conveniently
make any other use of the fire but that of warming the
room. When the room is warm, people, not seeing the
fire, are apt to forget supplying it with fuel till it is
almost out, then, growing cold, a great deal of wood is
put in, which soon makes it too hot. The change of
air is not carried on quite quick enough, so that if any
smoke or ill smell happens in the room, it is a long time
before it is discharged. For these reasons the Holland
stove has not obtained much among the English (who
love the sight of the fire) unless in some workshops,
where people are obliged to sit near windows for the
light, and in such places they have been found of good
use.</p>

<p>5. The German stove is like a box, one side wanting.
It is composed of five iron plates screwed together, and
fixed so as that you may put the fuel into it from another
room, or from the outside of the house. It is a
kind of oven reversed, its mouth being without, and
body within the room that is to be warmed by it. This
invention certainly warms a room very speedily and
thoroughly with little fuel: no quantity of cold air
comes in at any crevice, because there is no discharge
of air which it might supply, there being no passage
into the stove from the room. These are its conveniencies.
Its inconveniencies are, that people have
not even so much sight or use of the fire as in the Holland
stoves, and are, moreover, obliged to breathe the
same unchanged air continually, mixed with the breath
and perspiration from one another's bodies, which is
very disagreeable to those who have not been accustomed
to it.</p>

<p>6. Charcoal fires in pots are used chiefly in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>shops of handicraftsmen. They warm a room (that is
kept close, and has no chimney to carry off the warmed
air) very speedily and uniformly; but there being no
draught to change the air, the sulphurous fumes from
the coals [be they ever so well kindled before they are
brought in, there will be some] mix with it, render it
disagreeable, hurtful to some constitutions, and sometimes,
when the door is long kept shut, produce fatal
consequences.</p>

<p>To avoid the several inconveniencies, and at the
same time retain all the advantages of other fire-places,
was contrived the Pensylvania fire-place, now to be
described.</p>

<p>This machine consists of</p>

<p>A bottom-plate, (i) (<em>See the <a href="#PLATE_VIII">Plate</a> annexed</em>.)</p>

<p>A back plate, (ii)</p>

<p>Two side plates, (iii iii)</p>

<p>Two middle plates, (iv iv) which, joined together,
form a tight box, with winding passages in it for warming
the air.</p>

<p>A front plate, (v)</p>

<p>A top plate (vi)</p>

<p>These are all cast of iron, with mouldings or ledges
where the plates come together, to hold them fast, and
retain the mortar used for pointing to make tight joints.
When the plates are all in their places, a pair of slender
rods, with screws, are sufficient to bind the whole very
firmly together, as it appears in Fig. 2.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, two thin plates of wrought iron,
viz. the shutter, (vii) and the register, (viii); besides the
screw-rods O P, all which we shall explain in their
order.</p>

<p>(i) The bottom plate, or hearth-piece, is round before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with a rising moulding, that serves as a fender to keep
coals and ashes from coming to the floor, &amp;c. It has
two ears, F G, perforated to receive the screw-rods O P;
a long air-hole, <em>a a</em>, through which the fresh outward
air passes up into the air-box; and three smoke-holes
B C, through which the smoke descends and passes
away; all represented by dark squares. It has also
double ledges to receive between them the bottom
edges of the back plate, the two side-plates, and the
two middle plates. These ledges are about an inch
asunder, and about half an inch high; a profile of two
of them, joined to a fragment of plate, appears in
Fig. 3.</p>

<p>(ii) The back plate is without holes, having only a
pair of ledges on each side, to receive the back edges
of the two.</p>

<p>(iii iii) Side-plates: These have each a pair of ledges
to receive the side-edges of the front-plate, and a little
shoulder for it to rest on; also two pair of ledges to receive
the side-edges of the two middle plates which
form the air-box; and an oblong air-hole near the top,
through which is discharged into the room the air
warmed in the air-box. Each has also a wing or bracket,
H and I, to keep in falling brands, coals, &amp;c. and a
small hole, Q and R, for the axis of the register to
turn in.</p>

<p>(iv iv) The air-box is composed of the two middle
plates, D E and F G. The first has five thin ledges or
partitions cast on it, two inches deep, the edges of
which are received in so many pair of ledges cast in the
other. The tops of all the cavities formed by these
thin deep ledges, are also covered by a ledge of the
same form and depth, cast with them; so that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the plates are put together, and the joints luted, there
is no communication between the air-box and the
smoke. In the winding passages of this box, fresh air
is warmed as it passes into the room.</p>

<p>(v) The front plate is arched on the under side, and
ornamented with foliages, &amp;c. it has no ledges.</p>

<p>(vi) The top plate has a pair of ears, M N, answerable
to those in the bottom plate, and perforated for
the same purpose: it has also a pair of ledges running
round the under side, to receive the top edges of the
front, back, and side-plates. The air-box does not
reach up to the top plate by two inches and a half.</p>

<p>(vii) The shutter is of thin wrought iron and light,
of such a length and breadth as to close well the opening
of the fire-place. It is used to blow up the fire,
and to shut up and secure it at nights. It has two
brass knobs for handles, <em>d d</em>, and commonly slides up
and down in a groove, left, in putting up the fire-place,
between the foremost ledge of the side-plates, and the
face of the front plate; but some chuse to set it aside
when it is not in use, and apply it on occasion.</p>

<p>(viii) The register is also of thin wrought iron. It is
placed between the back plate and air-box, and can,
by means of the key S, be turned on its axis so as to
lie in any position between level and upright.</p>

<p>The screw-rods O P are of wrought iron, about a
third of an inch thick, with a button at bottom, and a
screw and nut at top, and may be ornamented with two
small brasses screwed on above the nuts.</p>

<p>To put this machine to work,</p>

<p>1. A false back of four inch (or, in shallow small
chimneys, two inch) brick work is to be made in the
chimney, four inches or more from the true back;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
from the top of this false back a closing is to be made
over to the breast of the chimney, that no air may pass
into the chimney, but what goes under the false back,
and up behind it.</p>

<p>2. Some bricks of the hearth are to be taken up, to
form a hollow under the bottom plate; across which
hollow runs a thin tight partition, to keep apart the air
entering the hollow and the smoke; and is therefore
placed between the air-hole and smoke-holes.</p>

<p>3. A passage is made, communicating with the outward
air, to introduce that air into the fore part of the
hollow under the bottom plate, whence it may rise
through the air-hole into the air-box.</p>

<p>4. A passage is made from the back part of the hollow,
communicating with the flue behind the false
back: through this passage the smoke is to pass.</p>

<p>The fire-place is to be erected upon these hollows,
by putting all the plates in their places, and screwing
them together.</p>

<p>Its operation may be conceived by observing the

<p>The fire being made at A, the flame and smoke will
ascend and strike the top T, which will thereby receive
a considerable heat. The smoke, finding no passage
upwards, turns over the top of the air-box, and
descends between it and the back plate to the holes
in the bottom plate, heating, as it passes, both plates
of the air-box, and the said back plate; the front plate,
bottom and side plates are also all heated at the same
time. The smoke proceeds in the passage that leads it
under and behind the false back, and so rises into the
chimney. The air of the room, warmed behind the
back plate, and by the sides, front, and top plates, becoming
specifically lighter than the other air in the
room, is obliged to rise; but the closure over the fireplace
hindering it from going up the chimney, it is
forced out into the room, rises by the mantle-piece to
the cieling, and spreads all over the top of the room,
whence being crouded down gradually by the stream of
newly-warmed air that follows and rises above it, the
whole room becomes in a short time equally warmed.</p>

<p>At the same time the air, warmed under the bottom
plate, and in the air-box, rises and comes out of the
holes in the side-plates, very swiftly, if the door of the
room be shut, and joins its current with the stream before-mentioned,
rising from the side, back, and top
plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The air that enters the room through the air-box is
fresh, though warm; and, computing the swiftness of
its motion with the areas of the holes, it is found that
near ten barrels of fresh air are hourly introduced by
the air-box; and by this means the air in the room is
continually changed, and kept, at the same time, sweet
and warm.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that the entering air will not be
warm at first lighting the fire, but heats gradually as the
fire increases.</p>

<p>A square opening for a trap-door should be left in
the closing of the chimney, for the sweeper to go up:
the door may be made of slate or tin, and commonly
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'kept closes hut'">kept close shut</ins>, but so placed as that, turning up against
the back of the chimney when open, it closes the vacancy
behind the false back, and shoots the soot, that
falls in sweeping, out upon the hearth. This trap-door
is a very convenient thing.</p>

<p>In rooms where much smoking of tobacco is used, it
is also convenient to have a small hole, about five or six
inches square, cut near the ceiling through into the
funnel: this hole must have a shutter, by which it may
be closed or opened at pleasure. When open, there
will be a strong draught of air through it into the chimney,
which will presently carry off a cloud of smoke,
and keep the room clear: if the room be too hot like-wise,
it will carry off as much of the warm air as you
please, and then you may stop it entirely, or in part, as
you think fit. By this means it is, that the tobacco
smoke does not descend among the heads of the company
near the fire, as it must do before it can get into
common chimneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><br /><em>The Manner of using this Fire-Place.</em></p>

<p>Your cord-wood must be cut into three lengths; or
else a short piece, fit for the fire-place, cut off, and the
longer left for the kitchen or other fires. Dry hickery,
or ash, or any woods that burn with a clear flame are
rather to be chosen, because such are less apt to foul
the smoke-passages with soot; and flame communicates
with its light, as well as by contact, greater heat to
the plates and room. But where more ordinary wood
is used, half a dry faggot of brush-wood, burnt at the
first making the fire in the morning, is very advantageous,
as it immediately, by its sudden blaze, heats the
plates, and warms the room (which with bad wood
slowly kindling would not be done so soon) and at the
same time by the length of its flame, turning in the
passages, consumes and cleanses away the soot that such
bad smoaky wood had produced therein the preceding
day, and so keeps them always free and clean. When
you have laid a little back log, and placed your billets
on small dogs, as in common chimneys, and put some
fire to them, then slide down your shutter as low as the
dogs, and the opening being by that means contracted,
the air rushes in briskly, and presently blows up the
flames. When the fire is sufficiently kindled, slide it
up again.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In some of these fire-places there is a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
six-inch square trap-door of thin wrought iron or brass,
covering a hole of like dimensions near the fore-part of
the bottom plate, which being by a ring lifted up towards
the fire, about an inch, where it will be retained
by two springing sides fixed to it perpendicularly (<em>See
the <a href="#PLATE_VIII-A">Plate</a>, Fig. 4.</em>) the air rushes in from the hollow under
the bottom plate, and blows the fire. Where this
is used, the shutter serves only to close the fire at
nights. The more forward you can make your fire on
the hearth-plate, not to be incommoded by the smoke,
the sooner and more will the room be warmed. At
night, when you go to bed, cover the coals or brands
with ashes as usual; then take away the dogs, and slide
down the shutter close to the bottom-plate, sweeping a
little ashes against it, that no air may pass under it;
then turn the register, so as very near to stop the flue
behind. If no smoke then comes out at crevices into
the room, it is right: if any smoke is perceived to come
out, move the register, so as to give a little draught, and
it will go the right way. Thus the room will be kept
warm all night; for the chimney being almost entirely
stopt, very little cold air, if any, will enter the room at
any crevice. When you come to re-kindle the fire in
the morning, turn open the register before you lift up
the slider, otherwise, if there be any smoke in the fireplace,
it will come out into the room. By the same use
of the shutter and register, a blazing fire may be presently
stifled, as well as secured, when you have occasion
to leave it for any time; and at your return you
will find the brands warm, and ready for a speedy rekindling.
The shutter alone will not stifle a fire, for it
cannot well be made to fit so exactly but that air will
enter, and that in a violent stream, so as to blow up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
keep alive the flames, and consume the wood, if the
draught be not checked by turning the register to shut
the flue behind. The register has also two other uses.
If you observe the draught of air into your fire-place to
be stronger than is necessary (as in extreme cold weather
it often is) so that the wood is consumed faster
than usual; in that case, a quarter, half, or two-thirds
turn of the register, will check the violence of the
draught, and let your fire burn with the moderation
you desire: and at the same time both the fire-place
and the room will be the warmer, because less cold air
will enter and pass through them. And if the chimney
should happen to take fire (which indeed there is very
little danger of, if the preceding direction be observed
in making fires, and it be well swept once a year; for,
much less wood being burnt, less soot is proportionably
made; and the fuel being soon blown into flame by the
shutter, or the trap-door bellows, there is consequently
less smoke from the fuel to make soot; then, though
the funnel should be foul, yet the sparks have such a
crooked up and down round about way to go, that they
are out before they get at it). I say, if ever it should be
on fire, a turn of the register shuts all close, and prevents
any air going into the chimney, and so the fire
may easily be stifled and mastered.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><em>The Advantages of this Fire-Place.</em></p>

<p>Its advantages above the common fire-places are,</p>

<p>1. That your whole room is equally warmed, so that
people need not croud so close round the fire, but may
sit near the window, and have the benefit of the light
for reading, writing, needle-work, &amp;c. They may sit
with comfort in any part of the room, which is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
considerable advantage in a large family, where there
must often be two fires kept, because all cannot conveniently
come at one.</p>

<p>2. If you sit near the fire, you have not that cold
draught of uncomfortable air nipping your back and
heels, as when before common fires, by which many
catch cold, being scorched before, and, as it were,
froze behind.</p>

<p>3. If you sit against a crevice, there is not that
sharp draught of cold air playing on you, as in rooms
where there are fires in the common way; by which
many catch cold, whence proceed coughs<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, catarrhs,
tooth-achs, fevers, pleurisies, and many other diseases.</p>

<p>4. In case of sickness, they make most excellent nursing
rooms; as they constantly supply a sufficiency of
fresh air, so warmed at the same time as to be no way
inconvenient or dangerous. A small one does well in
a chamber; and, the chimneys, being fitted for it, it
may be removed from one room to another, as occasion
requires, and fixed in half an hour. The equal temper
too, and warmth of the air of the room, is thought to
be particularly advantageous in some distempers; for it
was observed in the winters of 1730 and 1736, when the
small-pox spread in Pensylvania, that very few children
of the Germans died of that distemper in proportion to
those of the English; which was ascribed, by some, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the warmth and equal temper of air in their stove-rooms,
which made the disease as favourable as it commonly is
in the West Indies. But this conjecture we submit to
the judgment of physicians.</p>

<p>5. In common chimneys, the strongest heat from the
fire, which is upwards, goes directly up the chimney,
and is lost; and there is such a strong draught into the
chimney that not only the upright heat, but also the
back, sides, and downward heats are carried up the
chimney by that draught of air; and the warmth given
before the fire, by the rays that strike out towards the
room, is continually driven back, crouded into the
chimney, and carried up by the same draught of air.
But here the upright heat strikes and heats the top
plate, which warms the air above it, and that comes
into the room. The heat likewise, which the fire communicates
to the sides, back, bottom, and air-box, is all
brought into the room; for you will find a constant
current of warm air coming out of the chimney-corner
into the room. Hold a candle just under the mantle-piece,
or breast of your chimney, and you will see the
flame bent outwards: by laying a piece of smoaking
paper on the hearth, on either side, you may see how
the current of air moves, and where it tends, for it will
turn and carry the smoke with it.</p>

<p>6. Thus, as very little of the heat is lost, when this fire-place
is used, <em>much less wood</em><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> will serve you, which is
a considerable advantage where wood is dear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>7. When you burn candles near this fire-place, you
will find that the flame burns quite upright, and does
not blare and run the tallow down, by drawing towards
the chimney, as against common fires.</p>

<p>8. This fire-place cures most smoaky chimneys, and
thereby preserves both the eyes and furniture.</p>

<p>9. It prevents the fouling of chimneys; much of the
lint and dust that contributes to foul a chimney being,
by the low arch, obliged to pass through the flame,
where it is consumed. Then, less wood being burnt,
there is less smoke made. Again, the shutter, or trap-bellows,
soon blowing the wood into a flame, the same
wood does not yield so much smoke as if burnt in a
common chimney: for as soon as flame begins, smoke
in proportion ceases.</p>

<p>10. And if a chimney should be foul, it is much less
likely to take fire. If it should take fire, it is easily
stifled and extinguished.</p>

<p>11. A fire may be very speedily made in this fire-place
by the help of the shutter, or trap-bellows, as
aforesaid.</p>

<p>12. A fire may be soon extinguished, by closing it
with the shutter before, and turning the register behind,
which will stifle it, and the brands will remain ready to
rekindle.</p>

<p>13. The room being once warm, the warmth may be
retained in it all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>14. And lastly, the fire is so secured at night, that
not one spark can fly out into the room to do damage.</p>

<p>With all these conveniences, you do not lose the
pleasing sight nor use of the fire, as in the Dutch
stoves, but may boil the tea-kettle, warm the flat-irons,
heat heaters, keep warm a dish of victuals by setting it
on the top, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><em>Objections answered.</em></p>

<p>There are some objections commonly made by people
that are unacquainted with these fire-places, which
it may not be amiss to endeavour to remove, as they
arise from prejudices which might otherwise obstruct,
in some degree, the general use of this beneficial machine.
We frequently hear it said, <em>They are of the nature
of Dutch stoves</em>; <em>stoves have an unpleasant smell</em>;
<em>stoves are unwholesome</em>; <em>and, warm rooms make people
tender, and apt to catch cold</em>.&mdash;As to the first, that they
are of the nature of Dutch stoves, the description of
those stoves, in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'bginning of this'">beginning of this</ins> paper, compared
with that of these machines, shows that there is a most
material difference, and that these have vastly the advantage,
if it were only in the single article of the admission
and circulation of the fresh air. But it must
be allowed there may have been some cause to complain
of the offensive smell of iron stoves. This smell,
however, never proceeded from the iron itself, which,
in its nature, whether hot or cold, is one of the sweetest
of metals, but from the general uncleanly manner of
using those stoves. If they are kept clean, they are as
sweet as an ironing-box, which though ever so hot, never
offends the smell of the nicest lady: but it is common
to let them be greased, by setting candlesticks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
them, or otherwise; to rub greasy hands on them; and,
above all, to spit upon them, to try how hot they are,
which is an inconsiderate filthy unmannerly custom; for
the slimy matter of spittle drying on burns and fumes
when the stove is hot, as well as the grease, and smells
most nauseously, which makes such close stove-rooms,
where there is no draught to carry off those filthy vapours,
almost intolerable to those that are not from
their infancy accustomed to them. At the same time
nothing is more easy than to keep them clean; for
when by any accident they happen to be fouled, a lee
made of ashes and water, with a brush, will scour them
perfectly: as will also a little strong soft soap and
water.</p>

<p>That hot iron of itself gives no offensive smell, those
know very well who have (as the writer of this has)
been present at a furnace when the workmen were
pouring out the flowing metal to cast large plates, and
not the least smell of it to be perceived. That hot iron
does not, like lead, brass, and some other metals, give
out unwholesome vapours, is plain from the general
health and strength of those who constantly work in
iron, as furnace-men, forge-men, and smiths; that it is
in its nature a metal perfectly wholesome to the body
of man, is known from the beneficial use of chalybeate
or iron-mine-waters; from the good done by taking
steel filings in several disorders; and that even the
smithy water in which hot irons are quenched, is found
advantageous to the human constitution.&mdash;The ingenious
and learned Dr. Desaguliers, to whose instructive
writings the contriver of this machine acknowledges
himself much indebted, relates an experiment he made,
to try whether heated iron would yield unwholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
vapours: he took a cube of iron, and having given it a
very great heat, he fixed it so to a receiver, exhausted
by the air-pump, that all the air rushing in to fill the receiver,
should first pass through a hole in the hot iron.
He then put a small bird into the receiver, who breathed
that air without any inconvenience, or suffering the
least disorder. But the same experiment being made
with a cube of hot brass, a bird put into that air died
in a few minutes. Brass, indeed, stinks even when
cold, and much more when hot; lead, too, when hot,
yields a very unwholesome steam; but iron is always
sweet and every way taken is wholesome and friendly
to the human body&mdash;except in weapons.</p>

<p><em>That warmed rooms make people tender, and apt to catch
cold</em>, is a mistake as great as it is (among the English)
general. We have seen in the preceding pages how
the common rooms are apt to give colds; but the writer
of this paper may affirm from his own experience, and
that of his family and friends who have used warm
rooms for these four winters past, that by the use of
such rooms, people are rendered <em>less liable</em> to take cold,
and, indeed, <em>actually hardened</em>. If sitting warm in a
room made one subject to take cold on going out, lying
warm in bed, should by a parity of reason, produce the
same effect when we rise. Yet we find we can leap out
of the warmest bed naked, in the coldest morning,
without any such danger; and in the same manner out
of warm cloaths into a cold bed. The reason is, that
in these cases the pores all close at once, the cold is
shut out, and the heat within augmented, as we soon
after feel by the glowing of the flesh and skin. Thus
no one was ever known to catch cold by the use of the
cold bath: and are not cold baths allowed to harden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the bodies of those that use them? Are they not therefore
frequently prescribed to the tenderest constitutions?
Now every time you go out of a warm room into
the cold freezing air, you do as it were plunge into a
cold bath, and the effect is in proportion the same; for
(though perhaps you may feel somewhat chilly at first)
you find in a little time your bodies hardened and
strengthened, your blood is driven round with a brisker
circulation, and a comfortable steady uniform inward
warmth succeeds that equal outward warmth you first
received in the room. Farther to confirm this assertion,
we instance the Swedes, the Danes, and the Russians:
these nations are said to live in rooms, compared
to ours, as hot as ovens<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; yet where are the hardy soldiers,
though bred in their boasted cool houses, that
can, like these people, bear the fatigues of a winter
campaign in so severe a climate, march whole days
to the neck in snow, and at night entrench in ice as
they do?</p>

<p>The mentioning of those northern nations, puts me
in mind of a considerable <em>public advantage</em> that may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
arise from the general use of these fire-places. It is
observable, that though those countries have been well
inhabited for many ages, wood is still their fuel, and yet
at no very great price; which could not have been, if
they had not universally used stoves, but consumed it as
we do, in great quantities, by open fires. By the help
of this saving invention our wood may grow as fast as
we consume it, and our posterity may warm themselves
at a moderate rate, without, being obliged to fetch their
fuel over the Atlantic; as, if pit-coal should not be here
discovered (which is an uncertainty) they must necessarily
do.</p>

<p>We leave it to the <em>political arithmetician</em> to compute
how much money will be saved to a country, by its
spending two-thirds less of fuel; how much labour
saved in cutting and carriage of it; how much more
land may be cleared by cultivation; how great the profit
by the additional quantity of work done, in those
trades particularly that do not exercise the body so
much, but that the workfolks are obliged to run frequently
to the fire to warm themselves: and to physicians
to say, how much healthier thick-built towns and
cities will be, now half-suffocated with sulphury smoke,
when so much less of that smoke shall be made, and
the air breathed by the inhabitants be consequently so
much purer. These things it will suffice just to have
mentioned; let us proceed to give some necessary directions
to the workman who is to fix or set up these
fire-places.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><em>Directions to the Bricklayer.</em></p>

<p>The chimney being first well swept and cleansed
from soot, &amp;c. lay the bottom plate down on the hearth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
in the place where the fire-place is to stand, which may
be as forward as the hearth will allow. Chalk a line
from one of its back corners round the plate to the
other corner, that you may afterwards know its place
when you come to fix it; and from those corners, two
parallel lines to the back of the chimney: make marks
also on each side, that you may know where the partition
is to stand, which is to prevent any communication
between the air and smoke. Then, removing the plate,
make a hollow under it and beyond it, by taking up
as many of the bricks or tiles as you can, within your
chalked lines, quite to the chimney-back. Dig out
six or eight inches deep of the earth or rubbish, all the
breadth and length of your hollow; then make a passage
of four inches square (if the place will allow so
much) leading from the hollow to some place communicating
with the outer air; by <em>outer air</em> we mean air
without the room you intend to warm. This passage
may be made to enter your hollow on either side, or in
the fore part, just as you find most convenient, the circumstances
of your chimney considered. If the fire-place
is to be put up in a chamber, you may have this
communication of outer air from the stair-case; or
sometimes more easily from between the chamber floor,
and the ceiling of the lower room, making only a small
hole in the wall of the house entering the space betwixt
those two joists with which your air-passage in the
hearth communicates. If this air passage be so situated
as that mice may enter it, and nestle in the hollow, a
little grate of wire will keep them out. This passage
being made, and, if it runs under any part of the earth,
tiled over securely, you may proceed to raise your false
back. This may be of four inches or two inches thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>ness,
as you have room, but let it stand at least four
inches from the true chimney-back. In narrow chimneys
this false back runs from jamb to jamb, but in
large old-fashioned chimneys, you need not make it
wider than the back of the fire-place. To begin it, you
may form an arch nearly flat, of three bricks end to
end, over the hollow, to leave a passage the breadth of
the iron fire-place, and five or six inches deep, rounding
at bottom, for the smoke to turn and pass under the
false back, and so behind it up the chimney. The false
back is to rise till it is as high as the breast of the
chimney, and then to close over to the breast<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>; always
observing, if there is a wooden mantle-tree, to close
above it. If there is no wood in the breast, you may
arch over and close even with the lower part of the
breast. By this closing the chimney is made tight,
that no air or smoke can pass up it, without going under
the false back. Then from side to side of your hollow,
against the marks you made with chalk, raise a
tight partition, brick-on-edge, to separate the air from
the smoke, bevelling away to half an inch the brick
that comes just under the air-hole, that the air may
have a free passage up into the air-box: lastly, close
the hearth over that part of the hollow that is between
the false back and the place of the bottom plate, coming
about half an inch under the plate, which piece of
hollow hearth may be supported by a bit or two of old
iron-hoop; then is your chimney fitted to receive the
fire-place.</p>

<p>To set it, lay first a little bed of mortar all round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
edges of the hollow, and over the top of the partition:
then lay down your bottom plate in its place (with the
rods in it) and tread it till it lies firm. Then put a little
fine mortar (made of loam and lime, with a little hair)
into its joints, and set in your back plate, leaning it for
the present against the false back: then set in your
air-box, with a little mortar in its joints; then put in
the two sides, closing them up against the air-box,
with mortar in their grooves, and fixing at the same
time your register: then bring up your back to its
place, with mortar in its grooves, and that will bind the
sides together. Then put in your front plate, placing it
as far back in the groove as you can, to leave room for
the sliding plate: then lay on your top plate, with mortar
in its grooves also, screwing the whole firmly together
by means of the rods. The capital letters A B D E,
&amp;c. in <a href="#PLATE_VIII"><ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for the annexed cut, read Plate VIII.'">Plate VIII.</ins></a>, shew the corresponding parts
of the several plates. Lastly, the joints being pointed
all round on the outside, the fire-place is fit for use.</p>

<p>When you make your first fire in it, perhaps if the
chimney be thoroughly cold, it may not draw, the work
too being all cold and damp. In such case, put first a
few shovels of hot coals in the fire-place, then lift up
the chimney-sweeper's trap-door, and putting in a sheet
or two of flaming paper, shut it again, which will set
the chimney a drawing immediately, and when once it
is filled with a column of warm air, it will draw strongly
and continually.</p>

<p>The drying of the mortar and work by the first fire
may smell unpleasantly, but that will soon be over.</p>

<p>In some shallow chimneys, to make more room for
the false back and its flue, four inches or more of the
chimney back may be picked away.</p>

<p>Let the room be made as tight as conveniently it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
be, so will the outer air, that must come in to supply
the room and draught of the fire, be all obliged to enter
through the passage under the bottom plate, and up
through the air-box, by which means it will not come
cold to your backs, but be warmed as it comes in, and
mixed with the warm air round the fire-place, before it
spreads in the room.</p>

<p>But as a great quantity of cold air, in extreme cold
weather especially, will presently enter a room if the
door be carelessly left open, it is good to have some
contrivance to shut it, either by means of screw hinges,
a spring, or a pulley.</p>

<p>When the pointing in the joints is all dry and hard,
get some powder of black lead (broken bits of black
lead crucibles from the silver-smiths, pounded fine, will
do) and mixing it with a little rum and water, lay it on,
when the plates are warm, with a hard brush, over the
top and front-plates, part of the side and bottom-plates,
and over all the pointing; and, as it dries, rub it to a
gloss with the same brush, so the joints will not be discerned,
but it will look all of a piece, and shine like
new iron. And the false back being plaistered and
white-washed, and the hearth reddened, the whole will
make a pretty appearance. Before the black lead is
laid on, it would not be amiss to wash the plates with
strong lee and a brush, or soap and water, to cleanse
them from any spots of grease or filth that may be on
them. If any grease should afterwards come on them,
a little wet ashes will get it out.</p>

<p>If it be well set up, and in a tolerable good chimney,
smoke will draw in from as far as the fore part of the
bottom plate, as you may try by a bit of burning paper.</p>

<p>People are at first apt to make their rooms too
warm, not imagining how little a fire will be sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
When the plates are no hotter than that one may just
bear the hand on them, the room will generally be as
warm as you desire it.</p>

<p><em>Soon after the foregoing piece was published, some persons
in England, in imitation of Mr. Franklin's invention,
made what they call</em> Pensylvanian Fire-places, with improvements;
<em>the principal of which pretended improvements
is, a contraction of the passages in the air-box, originally
designed for admitting a quantity of fresh air, and
warming it as it entered the room. The contracting these
passages gains indeed more room for the grate, but in a
great measure defeats their intention. For if the passages
in the air-box do not greatly exceed in dimensions the
amount of all the crevices by which cold air can enter the
room, they will not considerably prevent, as they were intended
to do, the entry of cold air through these crevices.</em></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> As the writer is neither physician nor philosopher, the reader may expect
he should justify these his opinions by the authority of some that are
so. M. Clare, F. R. S. in his treatise of <cite>The Motion of Fluids</cite>, says, page
246, &amp;c. "And here it may be remarked, that it is more prejudicial to
health to sit near a window or door, in a room where there are many candles
and a fire, than in a room without; for the consumption of air thereby
occasioned, will always be very considerable, and this must necessarily be
replaced by cold air from without. Down the chimney can enter none,
the stream of warm air always arising therein absolutely forbids it, the
supply must therefore come in wherever other openings shall be found.
If these happen to be small, <em>let those who sit near them beware</em>; the smaller
the floodgate, the smarter will be the stream. Was a man, even in a
sweat, to leap into a cold bath, or jump from his warm bed, in the intensest
cold, even in a frost, provided he do not continue over-long therein, and
be in health when he does this, we see by experience that he gets no harm.
If he sits a little while against a window, into which a successive current
of cold air comes, his pores are closed, and he gets a fever. In the first
case, the shock the body endures, is general, uniform, and therefore less
fierce; in the other, a single part, a neck, or ear perchance, is attacked,
and that with the greater violence probably, as it is done by a successive
stream of cold air. And the cannon of a battery, pointed against a single
part of a bastion, will easier make a breach than were they directed to play
singly upon the whole face, and will admit the enemy much sooner into
the town."</p>

<p>That warm rooms, and keeping the body warm in winter, are means of
preventing such diseases, take the opinion of that learned Italian physician
Antonino Parcio, in the preface to his tract <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Militis Sanitate tuenda</cite>,
where, speaking of a particular wet and cold winter, remarkable at Venice
for its sickliness, he says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">"Popularis autem pleuritis quæ Venetiis sæviit
mensibus <em>Dec. Jan. Feb.</em> ex cæli, aërisque inclementia facta est, quod non
habeant hypocausta [<em>stove-rooms</em>] &amp; quod non soliciti sunt Itali omnes de
auribus, temporibus, collo, totoque corpore defendendis ab injuriis aëris;
et tegmina domorum Veneti disponant parum inclinata, ut nives diutius
permaneant super tegmina. E contra, Germani, qui experiuntur cæli inclementiam,
perdidicere sese defendere ab aëris injuria. Tecta construunt
multum inclinata, ut decidant nives. Germani abundant lignis, domusque
<em>hypocaustis</em>; foris autem incedunt pannis pellibus, gossipio, bene mehercule
loricati atque muniti. In Bavaria interrogabam (curiositate motus videndi
Germaniam) quot nam elapsis mensibus pleuritide vel peripneumonia
fuissent absumti: dicebant vix unus aut alter illis temporibus pleuritide
fuit correptus."</span></p>

<p>The great Dr. Boerhaave, whose authority alone might be sufficient, in
his <em>Aphorisms</em>, mentions, as one antecedent cause of pleurisies, "A cold
air, driven violently through some narrow passage upon the body, overheated
by labour or fire."</p>

<p>The eastern physicians agree with the Europeans in this point; witness
the Chinese treatise entitled, <cite>Tschang seng</cite>; i.e. <cite>The Art of procuring
Health and long Life</cite>, as translated in Pere Du Halde's account of China,
which has this passage. "As, of all the passions which ruffle us, anger does
the most mischief, so of all the malignant affections of the air, a wind that
comes through any narrow passage, which is cold and piercing, is most
dangerous; and coming upon us unawares insinuates itself into the body,
often causing grievous diseases. It should therefore be avoided, according
to the advice of the ancient proverb, as carefully as the point of an arrow."
These mischiefs are avoided by the use of the new-invented fire-places, as
will be shown hereafter.</p></div>

more equal. I suppose, taking a number of families together, that two-thirds,

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Causes and Cure of Smoky Chimnies.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>At Sea, Aug., 28, 1785.</em></p>

<p class="fs60 pad2">DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>In one of your letters, a little before I left France,
you desire me to give you in writing my thoughts upon
the construction and use of chimneys, a subject you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
had sometimes heard me touch upon in conversation.
I embrace willingly this leisure afforded by my present
situation to comply with your request, as it will not
only show my regard to the desires of a friend, but
may at the same time be of some utility to others; the
doctrine of chimneys appearing not to be as yet generally
well understood, and mistakes respecting them
being attended with constant inconvenience, if not remedied,
and with fruitless expence, if the true remedies
are mistaken.</p>

<p>Those who would be acquainted with this subject
should begin by considering on what principle smoke
ascends in any chimney. At first many are apt to think
that smoke is in its nature and of itself specifically
lighter than air, and rises in it for the same reason that
cork rises in water. These see no case why smoke
should not rise in the chimney, though the room be
ever so close. Others think there is a power in chimneys
to <em>draw</em> up the smoke, and that there are different
forms of chimneys which afford more or less of this
power. These amuse themselves with searching for
the best form. The equal dimensions of a funnel in
its whole length is not thought artificial enough, and it
is made, for fancied reasons, sometimes tapering and
narrowing from below upwards, and sometimes the
contrary, &amp;c. &amp;c. A simple experiment or two may
serve to give more correct ideas. Having lit a pipe of
tobacco, plunge the stem to the bottom of a decanter
half filled with cold water; then putting a rag over the
bowl, blow through it and make the smoke descend in
the stem of the pipe, from the end of which it will rise
in bubbles through the water; and being thus cooled,
will not afterwards rise to go out through the neck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the decanter, but remain spreading itself and resting
on the surface of the water. This shows that smoke is
really heavier than air, and that it is carried upwards
only when attached to, or acted upon, by air that is
heated, and thereby rarefied and rendered specifically
lighter than the air in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Smoke being rarely seen but in company with heated
air, and its upward motion being visible, though that of
the rarefied air that drives it is not so, has naturally
given rise to the error.</p>

<p>I need not explain to you, my learned friend, what
is meant by rarefied air; but if you make the public
use you propose of this letter, it may fall into the
hands of some who are unacquainted with the term
and with the thing. These then may be told, that air
is a fluid which has weight as well as others, though
about eight hundred times lighter than water. That
heat makes the particles of air recede from each
other and take up more space, so that the same weight
of air heated will have more bulk, than equal weights
of cold air which may surround it, and in that case
must rise, being forced upwards by such colder and
heavier air, which presses to get under it and take its
place. That air is so rarefied or expanded by heat
may be proved to their comprehension, by a lank blown
bladder, which, laid before a fire, will soon swell, grow
tight and burst.</p>

<p>Another experiment may be to take a glass tube
about an inch in diameter, and twelve inches long,
open at both ends and fixed upright on legs, so that it
need not be handled, for the hands might warm it. At
the end of a quill fasten five or six inches of the finest
light filament of silk, so that it may be held either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>above the upper end of the tube or under the lower
end, your warm hand being at a distance by the length
of the quill. (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate IX.</a> fig. 1.) If there were any motion
of air through the tube, it would manifest itself by its
effect on the silk; but if the tube and the air in it are
of the same temperature with the surrounding air, there
will be no such motion, whatever may be the form of
the tube, whether crooked or strait, narrow below and
widening upwards, or the contrary; the air in it will
be quiescent. Warm the tube, and you will find, as
long as it continues warm, a constant current of air
entering below and passing up through it, till discharged
at the top; because the warmth of the tube
being communicated to the air it contains rarefies that
air and makes it lighter than the air without, which
therefore presses in below, forces it upwards, and follows
and takes its place, and is rarefied in its turn.
And, without warming the tube, if you hold under it
a knob of hot iron, the air thereby heated will rise and
fill the tube, going out at its top, and this motion in
the tube will continue as long as the knob remains hot,
because the air entering the tube below is heated and
rarefied by passing near and over that knob.</p>

<p>That this motion is produced merely by the difference
of specific gravity between the fluid within and
that without the tube, and not by any fancied form of
the tube itself, may appear by plunging it into water
contained in a glass jar a foot deep, through which
such motion might be seen. The water within and
without the tube being of the same specific gravity, balance
each other, and both remain at rest. But take
out the tube, stop its bottom with a finger and fill it
with olive oil, which is lighter than water, then stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ping
the top, place it as before, its lower end under
water, its top a very little above. As long as you keep
the bottom stopt, the fluids remain at rest, but the moment
it is unstopt, the heavier enters below, forces up
the lighter, and takes its place. And the motion then
ceases, merely because the new fluid cannot be successively
made lighter, as air may be by a warm tube.</p>

<p>In fact, no form of the funnel of a chimney has any
share in its operation or effect respecting smoke, except
its height. The longer the funnel, if erect, the
greater its force when filled with heated and rarefied
air, to <em>draw</em> in below and drive up the smoke, if one
may, in compliance with custom, use the expression
<em>draw</em>, when in fact it is the superior weight of the surrounding
atmosphere that <em>presses</em> to enter the funnel below,
and so <em>drives up</em> before it the smoke and warm air
it meets with in its passage.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular in explaining these
first principles, because, for want of clear ideas respecting
them, much fruitless expence has been occasioned;
not only single chimneys, but in some instances, within
my knowledge, whole stacks having been pulled down
and rebuilt with funnels of different forms, imagined
more powerful in <em>drawing</em> smoke; but having still the
same height and the same opening below, have performed
no better than their predecessors.</p>

<p>What is it then which makes a <em>smoky chimney</em>, that
is, a chimney which, instead of conveying up all the
smoke, discharges a part of it into the room, offending
the eyes and damaging the furniture?</p>

<p>The causes of this effect, which have fallen under
my observation, amount to <em>nine</em>, differing from each
other, and therefore requiring different remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <em>Smoky chimneys in a new house, are such, frequently
from mere want of air.</em> The workmanship of the rooms
being all good, and just out of the workman's hand,
the joints of the boards of the flooring, and of the
pannels of wainscotting are all true and tight, the more
so as the walls, perhaps not yet thoroughly dry, preserve
a dampness in the air of the room which keeps
the wood-work swelled and close. The doors and the
sashes too, being worked with truth, shut with exactness,
so that the room is as tight as a snuff-box, no
passage being left open for air to enter, except the
key-hole, and even that is sometimes covered by a little
dropping shutter. Now if smoke cannot rise but as
connected with rarefied air, and a column of such air,
suppose it filling the funnel, cannot rise, unless other
air be admitted to supply its place; and if, therefore,
no current of air enter the opening of the chimney,
there is nothing to prevent the smoke coming out into
the room. If the motion upwards of the air in a chimney
that is freely supplied, be observed by the rising
of the smoke or a feather in it, and it be considered
that in the time such feather takes in rising from the
fire to the top of the chimney, a column of air equal
to the content of the funnel must be discharged, and
an equal quantity supplied from the room below, it will
appear absolutely impossible that this operation should
go on if the tight room is kept shut; for were there
any force capable of drawing constantly so much air
out of it, it must soon be exhausted like the receiver
of an air-pump, and no animal could live in it. Those
therefore who stop every crevice in a room to prevent
the admission of fresh air, and yet would have their
chimney carry up the smoke, require inconsistencies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and expect impossibilities. Yet under this situation, I
have seen the owner of a new house, in despair, and
ready to sell it for much less than it cost, conceiving
it uninhabitable, because not a chimney in any
one of its rooms would carry off the smoke, unless a
door or window were left open. Much expence has
also been made, to alter and amend new chimneys
which had really no fault; in one house particularly
that I knew, of a nobleman in Westminster, that expence
amounted to no less than three hundred pounds,
<em>after</em> his house had been, as he thought, finished and
all charges paid. And after all, several of the alterations
were ineffectual, for want of understanding the
true principles.</p>

<p><em>Remedies.</em> When you find on trial, that opening the
door or a window, enables the chimney to carry up all
the smoke, you may be sure that want of air <em>from without</em>,
was the cause of its smoking. I say <em>from without</em>,
to guard you against a common mistake of those who
may tell you, the room is large, contains abundance of
air, sufficient to supply any chimney, and therefore it
cannot be that the chimney wants air. These reasoners
are ignorant, that the largeness of a room, if tight,
is in this case of small importance, since it cannot part
with a chimney full of its air without occasioning so
much vacuum; which it requires a great force to effect,
and could not be borne if effected.</p>

<p>It appearing plainly, then, that some of the outward
air must be admitted, the question will be, how
much is <em>absolutely necessary</em>; for you would avoid admitting
more, as being contrary to one of your intentions
in having a fire, viz. that of warming your room.
To discover this quantity, shut the door gradually while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a middling fire is burning, till you find that, before it
is quite shut, the smoke begins to come out into the
room, then open it a little till you perceive the smoke
comes out no longer. There hold the door, and observe
the width of the open crevice between the edge
of the door and the rabbit it should shut into. Suppose
the distance to be half an inch, and the door
eight feet high, you find thence that your room requires
an entrance for air equal in area to ninety-six
half inches, or forty-eight square inches, or a passage
of six inches by eight. This however is a large supposition,
there being few chimneys, that, having a moderate
opening and a tolerable height of funnel, will
not be satisfied with such a crevice of a quarter of an
inch; and I have found a square of six by six, or
thirty-six square inches, to be a pretty good medium,
that will serve for most chimneys. High funnels, with
small and low openings, may indeed be supplied thro'
a less space, because, for reasons that will appear hereafter,
the <em>force of levity</em>, if one may so speak, being
greater in such funnels, the cool air enters the room
with greater velocity, and consequently more enters in
the same time. This however has its limits; for experience
shows, that no increased velocity, so occasioned,
has made the admission of air through the
key-hole equal in quantity to that through an open
door; though through the door the current moves
slowly, and through the key-hole with great rapidity.</p>

<p>It remains then to be considered how and where this
necessary quantity of air from without is to be admitted
so as to be least inconvenient. For if at the door,
left so much open, the air thence proceeds directly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the chimney, and in its way comes cold to your back
and heels as you sit before your fire. If you keep the
door shut, and raise a little the sash of your window,
you feel the same inconvenience. Various have been
the contrivances to avoid this, such as bringing in fresh
air through pipes in the jams of the chimney, which,
pointing upwards, should blow the smoke up the funnel;
opening passages into the funnel above, to let in air for
the same purpose. But these produce an effect contrary
to that intended: for as it is the constant current
of air passing from the room <em>through the opening of the
chimney</em> into the funnel which prevents the smoke coming
out into the room, if you supply the funnel by
other means or in other ways with the air it wants, and
especially if that air be cold, you diminish the force of
that current, and the smoke in its effort to enter the
room finds less resistance.</p>

<p>The wanted air must then <em>indispensably</em> be admitted
into the room, to supply what goes off through the
opening of the chimney. M. Gauger, a very ingenious
and intelligent French writer on the subject, proposes
with judgment to admit it <em>above</em> the opening of the
chimney; and to prevent inconvenience from its coldness,
he directs its being made to pass in its entrance
through winding cavities made behind the iron back
and sides of the fire-place, and under the iron hearth-plate;
in which cavities it will be warmed, and even
heated, so as to contribute much, instead of cooling,
to the warming of the room. This invention is excellent
in itself, and may be used with advantage in building
new houses; because the chimneys may then be so
disposed, as to admit conveniently the cold air to enter
such passages: but in houses built without such views,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the chimneys are often so situated, as not to afford that
convenience, without great and expensive alterations.
Easy and cheap methods, though not quite so perfect in
themselves, are of more general utility; and such are
the following.</p>

<p>In all rooms where there is a fire, the body of air
warmed and rarefied before the chimney is continually
changing place, and making room for other air that is
to be warmed in its turn. Part of it enters and goes up
the chimney, and the rest rises and takes place near the
ceiling. If the room be lofty, that warm air remains
above our heads as long as it continues warm, and we
are little benefited by it, because it does not descend till
it is cooler. Few can imagine the difference of climate
between the upper and lower parts of such a room, who
have not tried it by the thermometer, or by going up a
ladder till their heads are near the ceiling. It is then
among this warm air that the wanted quantity of outward
air is best admitted, with which being mixed, its
coldness is abated, and its inconvenience diminished so
as to become scarce observable. This may be easily
done, by drawing down about an inch the upper sash of
a window; or, if not moveable, by cutting such a crevice
through its frame; in both which cases, it will be
well to place a thin shelf of the length, to conceal the
opening, and sloping upwards to direct the entering air
horizontally along and under the ceiling. In some
houses the air may be admitted by such a crevice made
in the wainscot, cornish or plastering, near the ceiling
and over the opening of the chimney. This, if practicable,
is to be chosen, because the entering cold air will
there meet with the warmest rising air from before the
fire, and be soonest tempered by the mixture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
same kind of shelf should also be placed here. Another
way, and not a very difficult one, is to take out an upper
pane of glass in one of your sashes, set in a tin
frame, (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Fig. 2.) giving it two springing angular
sides, and then replacing it, with hinges below on
which it may be turned to open more or less above. It
will then have the appearance of an internal sky light.
By drawing this pane in, more or less, you may admit
what air you find necessary. Its position will naturally
throw that air up and along the ceiling. This is what
is called in France a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Was ist das?</i> As this is a German
question, the invention is probably of that nation, and
takes its name from the frequent asking of that question
when it first appeared. In England, some have of late
years cut a round hole about five inches diameter in a
pane of the sash and placed against it a circular plate
of tin hung on an axis, and cut into vanes, which, being
separately bent a little obliquely, are acted upon by the
entering air, so as to force the plate continually round
like the vanes of a windmill. This admits the outward
air, and by the continual whirling of the vanes, does in
some degree disperse it. The noise only, is a little inconvenient.</p>

<p>2. A second cause of the smoking of chimneys is,
<em>their openings in the room being too large</em>; that is, too
wide, too high, or both. Architects in general have no
other ideas of proportion in the opening of a chimney,
than what relate to symmetry and beauty, respecting
the dimensions of the room;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> while its true proportion,
respecting its function and utility depends on quite
other principles; and they might as properly proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the step in a stair-case to the height of the story, instead
of the natural elevation of men's legs in mounting.
The proportion then to be regarded, is what relates
to the height of the funnel. For as the funnels in
the different stories of a house are necessarily of different
heights or lengths, that from the lowest floor being
the highest or longest, and those of the other floors
shorter and shorter, till we come to those in the garrets,
which are of course the shortest; and the force of draft
being, as already said, in proportion to the height of
funnel filled with rarefied air; and a current of air from
the room into the chimney, sufficient to fill the opening,
being necessary to oppose and prevent the smoke
coming out into the room; it follows, that the openings
of the longest funnels may be larger, and that those of
the shorter funnels should be smaller. For if there be
a large opening to a chimney that does not draw
strongly, the funnel may happen to be furnished with
the air it demands by a partial current entering on one
side of the opening, and, leaving the other side free of
any opposing current, may permit the smoke to issue
there into the room. Much too of the force of draft
in a funnel depends on the degree of rarefaction in the
air it contains, and that depends on the nearness to the
fire of its passage in entering the funnel. If it can enter
far from the fire on each side, or far above the fire
in a wide or high opening, it receives little heat in passing
by the fire, and the contents of the funnel is by
that means less different in levity from the surrounding
atmosphere, and its force in drawing consequently
weaker. Hence if too large an opening be given to
chimneys in upper rooms, those rooms will be smoky:
on the other hand, if too small openings be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
chimneys in the lower rooms, the entering air, operating
too directly and violently on the fire, and afterwards
strengthening the draft as it ascends the funnel, will
consume the fuel too rapidly.</p>

<p><em>Remedy.</em> As different circumstances frequently mix
themselves in these matters, it is difficult to give precise
dimensions for the openings of all chimneys. Our fathers
made them generally much too large; we have
lessened them; but they are often still of greater dimension
than they should be, the human eye not being
easily reconciled to sudden and great changes. If you
suspect that your chimney smokes from the too great
dimension of its opening, contract it by placing moveable
boards so as to lower and narrow it gradually, till
you find the smoke no longer issues into the room. The
proportion so found will be that which is proper for
that chimney, and you may employ the bricklayer or
mason to reduce it accordingly. However, as, in
building new houses, something must be sometimes
hazarded, I would make the openings in my lower
rooms about thirty inches square and eighteen deep,
and those in the upper, only eighteen inches square and
not quite so deep; the intermediate ones diminishing
in proportion as the height of funnel diminished. In
the larger openings, billets of two feet long, or half the
common length of cordwood, may be burnt conveniently;
and for the smaller, such wood may be sawed into
thirds. Where coals are the fuel, the grates will be
proportioned to the openings. The same depth is
nearly necessary to all, the funnels being all made of a
size proper to admit a chimney-sweeper. If in large
and elegant rooms custom or fancy should require the
appearance of a larger chimney, it may be formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
expensive marginal decorations, in marble, &amp;c. In
time perhaps, that which is fittest in the nature of things
may come to be thought handsomest. But at present,
when men and women in different countries show
themselves dissatisfied with the forms God has given to
their heads, waists and feet, and pretend to shape them
more perfectly, it is hardly to be expected that they
will be content always with the best form of a chimney.
And there are some, I know, so bigotted to the fancy of
a large noble opening, that rather than change it, they
would submit to have damaged furniture, sore eyes, and
skins almost smoked to bacon.</p>

<p>3. Another cause of smoky chimneys is, <em>too short a
funnel</em>. This happens necessarily in some cases, as
where a chimney is required in a low building; for, if
the funnel be raised high above the roof, in order to
strengthen its draft, it is then in danger of being blown
down, and crushing the roof in its fall.</p>

<p><em>Remedies</em>. Contract the opening of the chimney, so
as to oblige all the entering air to pass through or very
near the fire; whereby it will be more heated and rarefied,
the funnel itself be more warmed, and its contents
have more of what may be called the force of levity, so
as to rise strongly and maintain a good draft at the
opening.</p>

<p>Or you may in some cases, to advantage, build additional
stories over the low building, which will support
a high funnel.</p>

<p>If the low building be used as a kitchen, and a contraction
of the opening therefore inconvenient, a large
one being necessary, at least when there are great dinners,
for the free management of so many cooking
utensils; in such case, I would advise the building of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
more funnels joining to the first, and having three moderate
openings, one to each funnel, instead of one
large one. When there is occasion to use but one, the
other two may be kept shut by sliding plates, hereafter
to be described;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and two or all of them may be used
together when wanted. This will indeed be an expence,
but not an useless one, since your cooks will
work with more comfort, see better than in a smoky
kitchen what they are about, your victuals will be
cleaner dressed, and not taste of smoke, as is often the
case; and to render the effect more certain, a stack of
three funnels may be safely built higher above the roof
than a single funnel.</p>

<p>The case of too short a funnel is more general than
would be imagined, and often found where one would
not expect it. For it is not uncommon, in ill-contrived
buildings, instead of having a funnel for each room or
fire-place, to bend and turn the funnel of an upper room
so as to make it enter the side of another funnel that
comes from below. By this means the upper room
funnel is made short of course, since its length can only
be reckoned from the place where it enters the lower
room funnel; and that funnel is also shortened by all
the distance between the entrance of the second funnel
and the top of the stack: for all that part being readily
supplied with air through the second funnel, adds no
strength to the draught, especially as that air is cold
when there is no fire in the second chimney. The only
easy remedy here is, to keep the opening shut of that
funnel in which there is no fire.</p>

<p>4. Another very common cause of the smoking of</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p>chimneys, is, <em>their overpowering one another</em>. For instance,
if there be two chimneys in one large room, and
you make fires in both of them, the doors and windows
close shut, you will find that the greater and stronger
fire shall overpower the weaker, and draw air down its
funnel to supply its own demand; which air descending
in the weaker funnel will drive down its smoke, and
force it into the room. If, instead of being in one
room, the two chimneys are in two different rooms,
communicating by a door, the case is the same whenever
that door is open. In a very tight house, I have known
a kitchen chimney on the lowest floor, when it had a
great fire in, it, overpower any other chimney in the
house, and draw air and smoke into its room, as often
as the door was opened communicating with the stair-case.</p>

<p><em>Remedy.</em> Take care that every room has the means
of supplying itself from without, with the air its chimney
may require, so that no one of them may be obliged
to borrow from another, nor under the necessity of
lending. A variety of these means have been already
described.</p>

<p>5. Another cause of smoking is, <em>when the tops of chimneys
are commanded by higher buildings, or by a hill</em>, so
that the wind blowing over such eminences falls like
water over a dam, sometimes almost perpendicularly on
the tops of the chimneys that lie in its way, and beats
down the smoke contained in them.</p>

<p><em>Remedy.</em> That commonly applied to this case, is a
turncap made of tin or plate iron, covering the chimney
above and on three sides, open on one side, turning on
a spindle, and which, being guided or governed by a
vane, always presents its back to the current. This I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
believe may be generally effectual, though not certain,
as there may be cases in which it will not succeed.
Raising your funnels, if practicable, so as their tops may
be higher, or at least equal with the commanding eminence,
is more to be depended on. But the turning
cap, being easier and cheaper, should first be tried. If
obliged to build in such a situation, I would chuse to
place my doors on the side next the hill, and the backs
of my chimneys on the furthest side; for then the column
of air falling over the eminence, and of course
pressing on that below and forcing it to enter the doors
or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Was ist das</i>es on that side, would tend to balance the
pressure down the chimneys, and leave the funnels more
free in the exercise of their functions.</p>

<p>6. There is another case of command, the reverse of
that last mentioned. It is where the commanding eminence
is farther from the wind than the chimney commanded.
To explain this a figure may be necessary.
Suppose then a building whose side A happens to be
exposed to the wind, and forms a kind of dam against
its progress. (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure 3.) The air obstructed
by this dam will, like water, press and search <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'for pasages'">for passages</ins>
through it; and finding the top of the chimney B,
below the top of the dam, it will force itself down that
funnel, in order to get through by some door or window
open on the other side of the building. And if
there be a fire in such chimney, its smoke is of course
beat down, and fills the room.</p>

<p><em>Remedy.</em> I know of but one, which is to raise such
funnel higher than the roof, supporting it, if necessary
by iron bars. For a turn-cap in this case has no effect,
the dammed up air pressing down through it in whatever
position the wind may have placed its opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>I know a city in which many houses are rendered
smoky by this operation. For their kitchens being
built behind, and connected by a passage with the
houses, and the tops of the kitchen chimneys lower
than the top of the houses, the whole side of a street,
when the wind blows against its back, forms such a dam,
as above described; and the wind, so obstructed, forces
down those kitchen chimneys (especially when they
have but weak fires in them) to pass through the passage
and house into the street. Kitchen chimneys, so
formed and situated, have another inconvenience. In
summer, if you open your upper room windows for air,
a light breeze blowing over your kitchen chimney towards
the house, though not strong enough to force
down its smoke as aforesaid, is sufficient to waft it into
your windows, and fill the rooms with it; which, besides
the disagreeableness, damages your furniture.</p>

<p>7. Chimneys, otherwise drawing well, are sometimes
made to smoke by <em>the improper and inconvenient situation
of a door</em>. When the door and chimney are on the
same side of the room as in the figure, if the door A,
being in the corner, is made to open against the wall
(<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure 4) which is common, as being there,
when open, more out of the way, it follows, that when
the door is only opened in part, a current of air rushing
in passes along the wall into and across the opening of
the chimney B, and flirts some of the smoke out into
the room. This happens more certainly when the door
is shutting, for then the force of the current is augmented,
and becomes very inconvenient to those who,
warming themselves by the fire, happen to sit in its
way.</p>

<p>The <em>remedies</em> are obvious and easy. Either put an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
intervening skreen from the wall round great part of the
fire-place; or, which is perhaps preferable, shift the
hinges of your door, so as it may open the other way,
and when open throw the air along the other wall.</p>

<p>8. A room, that has no fire in its chimney, is sometimes
filled with <em>smoke which is received at the top of its
funnel and descends into the room</em>. In a former paper<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
I have already explained the descending currents of air
in cold funnels; it may not be amiss however to repeat
here, that funnels without fires have an effect, according
to their degree of coldness or warmth, on the air that
happens to be contained in them. The surrounding
atmosphere is frequently changing its temperature; but
stacks of funnels, covered from winds and sun by the
house that contains them, retain a more equal temperature.
If, after a warm season, the outward air suddenly
grows cold, the empty warm funnels begin to draw
strongly upward; that is, they rarefy the air contained
in them, which of course rises, cooler air enters below
to supply its place, is rarefied in its turn and rises; and
this operation continues till the funnel grows cooler, or
the outward air warmer, or both, when the motion
ceases. On the other hand, if after a cold season, the
outward air suddenly grows warm and of course lighter,
the air contained in the cool funnels, being heavier, descends
into the room; and the warmer air which enters
their tops being cooled in its turn, and made heavier,
continues to descend; and this operation goes on, till
the funnels are warmed by the passing of warm air
through them, or the air itself grows cooler. When
the temperature of the air and of the funnels is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
equal, the difference of warmth in the air between day
and night is sufficient to produce these currents, the air
will begin to ascend the funnels as the cool of the evening
comes on, and this current will continue till perhaps
nine or ten o'clock the next morning, when it begins
to hesitate; and as the heat of the day approaches, it
sets downwards, and continues so till towards evening,
when it again hesitates for some time, and then goes
upwards constantly during the night, as before mentioned.
Now when smoke issuing from the tops of
neighbouring funnels passes over the tops of funnels
which are at the time drawing downwards, as they often
are in the middle part of the day, such smoke is of necessity
drawn into these funnels, and descends with the
air into the chamber.</p>

<p>The <em>remedy</em> is to have a sliding plate, hereafter described<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>,
that will shut perfectly the offending funnel.</p>

<p>9. Chimneys which generally draw well, do nevertheless
sometimes give smoke into the rooms, <em>it being driven
down by strong winds passing over the tops of their funnels</em>,
though not descending from any commanding
eminence. This case is most frequent where the funnel
is short, and the opening turned from the
wind. It is the more grievous, when it happens to be
a cold wind that produces the effect, because when you
most want your fire, you are sometimes obliged to extinguish
it. To understand this, it may be considered
that the rising light air, to obtain a free issue from the
funnel, must push out of its way or oblige the air that
is over it to rise. In a time of calm or of little wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
this is done visibly, for we see the smoke that is brought
up by that air rise in a column above the chimney.
But when a violent current of air, that is, a strong wind,
passes over the top of a chimney, its particles have received
so much force, which keeps them in a horizontal
direction and follow each other so rapidly, that the
rising light air has not strength sufficient to oblige
them to quit that direction and move upwards to permit
its issue. Add to this, that some of the current
passing over that side of the funnel which it first meets
with, viz. at A, (<a href="#PLATE_IX"><ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for Plate I, read Plate IX'">Plate IX</ins></a>. Figure 5.) having been compressed
by the resistance of the funnel, may expand
itself over the flue, and strike the interior opposite side
at B, from whence it may be reflected downwards and
from side to side in the direction of the pricked lines
c c c.</p>

<p><em>Remedies.</em> In some places, particularly in Venice,
where they have not stacks of chimneys but single flues,
the custom is, to open or widen the top of the flue
rounding in the true form of a funnel; (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure
6) which some think may prevent the effect just
mentioned, for that the wind blowing over one of the
edges into the funnel may be slanted out again on the
other side by its form. I have had no experience of
this; but I have lived in a windy country, where the
contrary is practised, the tops of the flues being <em>narrowed</em>
inwards, so as to form a slit for the issue of the
smoke, long as the breadth of the funnel, and only four
inches wide. This seems to have been contrived on a
supposition, that the entry of the wind would thereby be
obstructed, and perhaps it might have been imagined,
that the whole force of the rising warm air being con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>densed,
as it were, in the narrow opening, would
thereby be strengthened, so as to overcome the resistance
of the wind. This however did not always succeed;
for when the wind was at north-east and blew
fresh, the smoke was forced down by fits into the room
I commonly sat in, so as to oblige me to shift the fire
into another. The position of the slit of this funnel
was indeed north-east and south-west. Perhaps if it
had lain across the wind, the effect might have been
different. But on this I can give no certainty. It
seems a matter proper to be referred to experiment.
Possibly a turn-cap might have been serviceable, but it
was not tried.</p>

<p>Chimneys have not been long in use in England. I
formerly saw a book printed in the time of queen Elizabeth,
which remarked the then modern improvements
of living, and mentioned among others the
convenience of chimneys. "Our forefathers," said the
author, "had no chimneys. There was in each dwelling
house only one place for a fire, and the smoke went
out through a hole in the roof; but now there is scarce
a gentleman's house in England that has not at least
one chimney in it."&mdash;When there was but one chimney,
its top might then be opened as a funnel, and perhaps,
borrowing the form from the Venetians, it was then the
flue of a chimney got that name. Such is now the
growth of luxury, that in both England and France we
must have a chimney for every room, and in some
houses every possessor of a chamber, and almost every
servant, will have a fire; so that the flues being necessarily
built in stacks, the opening of each as a funnel
is impracticable. This change of manners soon consumed
the firewood of England, and will soon render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
fuel extremely scarce and dear in France, if the use of
coals be not introduced in the latter kingdom as it has
been in the former, where it at first met with opposition;
for there is extant in the records of one of queen
Elizabeth's parliaments, a motion made by a member,
reciting, "That many dyers, brewers, smiths, and other
artificers of London, had of late taken to the use of pit-coal
for their fires, instead of wood, which filled the air
with noxious vapours and smoke, very prejudicial to
the health, particularly of persons coming out of the
country; and therefore moving that a law might pass
to prohibit the use of such fuel (at least during the session
of parliament) by those artificers."&mdash;It seems it was
not then commonly used in private houses. Its supposed
unwholesomeness was an objection. Luckily the
inhabitants of London have got over that objection,
and now think it rather contributes to render their air
salubrious, as they have had no general pestilential disorder
since the general use of coals, when, before it,
such were frequent. Paris still burns wood at an enormous
expence continually augmenting, the inhabitants
having still that prejudice to overcome. In Germany
you are happy in the use of stoves, which save fuel
wonderfully: your people are very ingenious in the management
of fire; but they may still learn something in
that art from the Chinese<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, whose country being greatly
populous and fully cultivated, has little room left for
the growth of wood, and having not much other fuel
that is good, have been forced upon many inventions
during a course of ages, for making a little fire go as
far as possible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<p>I have thus gone through all the common causes of
the smoking of chimneys that I can at present recollect
as having fallen under my observation; communicating
the remedies that I have known successfully used for
the different cases, together with the principles on which
both the disease and the remedy depend, and confessing
my ignorance wherever I have been sensible of it. You
will do well, if you publish, as you propose, this letter,
to add in notes, or as you please, such observations as
may have occurred to your attentive mind; and if other
philosophers will do the same, this part of science,
though humble, yet of great utility, may in time be perfected.
For many years past, I have rarely met with a
case of a smoky chimney, which has not been solvable
on these principles, and cured by these remedies, where
people have been willing to apply them; which is indeed
not always the case; for many have prejudices in
favour of the nostrums of pretending chimney-doctors
and fumists, and some have conceits and fancies of their
own, which they rather chuse to try, than to lengthen
a funnel, alter the size of an opening, or admit air into
a room, however necessary; for some are as much
afraid of fresh air as persons in the hydrophobia are of
fresh water. I myself had formerly this prejudice, this
<em>aerophobia</em>, as I now account it, and dreading the supposed
dangerous effects of cool air, I considered it as
an enemy, and closed with extreme care every crevice
in the rooms I inhabited. Experience has convinced
me of my error. I now look upon fresh air as a friend:
I even sleep with an open window. I am persuaded
that no common air from without, is so unwholesome
as the air within a close room that has been often
breathed and not changed. Moist air too, which for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>merly
I thought pernicious, gives me now no apprehensions:
for considering that no dampness of air applied
to the outside of my skin can be equal to what is
applied to and touches it within, my whole body being
full of moisture, and finding that I can lie two hours in
a bath twice a week, covered with water, which certainly
is much damper than any air can be, and this for
years together, without catching cold, or being in any
other manner disordered by it, I no longer dread mere
moisture, either in air or in sheets or shirts: and I find it
of importance to the happiness of life, the being freed
from vain terrors, especially of objects that we are every
day exposed inevitably to meet with. You physicians
have of late happily discovered, after a contrary opinion
had prevailed some ages, that fresh and cool air does
good to persons in the small pox and other fevers. It
is to be hoped, that in another century or two we may
all find out, that it is not bad even for people in health.
And as to moist air, here I am at this present writing
in a ship with above forty persons, who have had no
other but moist air to breathe for six weeks past;
every thing we touch is damp, and nothing dries, yet
we are all as healthy as we should be on the mountains
of Switzerland, whose inhabitants are not more so than
those of Bermuda or St. Helena, islands on whose rocks
the waves are dashed into millions of particles, which
fill the air with damp, but produce no diseases, the
moisture being pure, unmixed with the poisonous vapours
arising from putrid marshes and stagnant pools, in
which many insects die and corrupt the water. These
places only, in my opinion (which however I submit to
yours) afford unwholesome air; and that it is not the
mere water contained in damp air, but the volatile par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>ticles
of corrupted animal matter mixed with that water,
which renders such air pernicious to those who
breathe it. And I imagine it a cause of the same kind
that renders the air in close rooms, where the perspirable
matter is breathed over and over again by a number
of assembled, people so hurtful to health. After being
in such a situation, many find themselves affected by
that <em>febricula</em>, which the English alone call a <em>cold</em>, and,
perhaps from the name, imagine that they caught the
malady by <em>going out</em> of the room, when it was in fact by
being in it.</p>

<p>You begin to think that I wander from my subject,
and go out of my depth. So I return again to my
chimneys.</p>

<p>We have of late many lecturers in experimental philosophy.
I have wished that some of them would study
this branch of that science, and give experiments in it
as a part of their lectures. The addition to their present
apparatus need not be very expensive. A number
of little representations of rooms composed each of five
panes of sash glass, framed in wood at the corners, with
proportionable doors, and moveable glass chimneys, with
openings of different sizes, and different lengths of funnel,
and some of the rooms so contrived as to communicate
on occasion with others, so as to form different
combinations, and exemplify different cases; with quantities
of green wax taper cut into pieces of an inch and
half, sixteen of which stuck together in a square, and
lit, would make a strong fire for a little glass chimney,
and blown out would continue to burn and give smoke
as long as desired. With such an apparatus all the
operations of smoke and rarified air in rooms and chimneys
might be seen through their transparent sides; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the effect of winds on chimneys, commanded or otherwise,
might be shown, by letting the entering air blow
upon them through an opened window of the lecturer's
chamber, where it would be constant while he kept a
good fire in his chimney. By the help of such lectures
our fumists would become better instructed. At present
they have generally but one remedy, which perhaps
they have known effectual in some one case of
smoky chimneys, and they apply that indiscriminately
to all the other cases, without success,&mdash;but not without
expence to their employers.</p>

<p>With all the science, however, that a man shall suppose
himself possessed of in this article, he may sometimes
meet with cases that shall puzzle him. I once
lodged in a house at London, which, in a little room,
had a single chimney and funnel. The opening was
very small, yet it did not keep in the smoke, and all attempts
to have a fire in this room were fruitless. I
could not imagine the reason, till at length observing
that the chamber over it, which had no fire-place in it,
was always filled with smoke when a fire was kindled
below and that the smoke came through the cracks and
crevices of the wainscot; I had the wainscot taken
down, and discovered that the funnel, which went up
behind it, had a crack many feet in length, and wide
enough to admit my arm, a breach very dangerous with
regard to fire, and occasioned probably by an apparent
irregular settling of one side of the house. The air entering
this breach freely, destroyed the drawing force
of the funnel. The remedy would have been, filling up
the breach or rather rebuilding the funnel: but the
landlord rather chose to stop up the chimney.</p>

<p>Another puzzling case I met with at a friend's coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>try
house near London. His best room had a chimney
in which, he told me, he never could have a fire, for
all the smoke came out into the room. I flattered myself
I could easily find the cause, and prescribe the cure.
I had a fire made there, and found it as he said. I
opened the door, and perceived it was not want of air.
I made a temporary contraction of the opening of the
chimney, and found that it was not its being too large
that caused the smoke to issue. I went out and looked
up at the top of the chimney: its funnel was joined in
the same stack with others, some of them shorter, that
drew very well, and I saw nothing to prevent its doing
the same. In fine, after every other examination I
could think of, I was obliged to own the insufficiency
of my skill. But my friend, who made no pretension
to such kind of knowledge, afterwards discovered the
cause himself. He got to the top of the funnel by a
ladder, and looking down, found it filled with twigs and
straw cemented by earth, and lined with feathers. It
seems the house, after being built, had stood empty
some years before he occupied it; and he concluded
that some large birds had taken the advantage of its
retired situation to make their nest there. The rubbish,
considerable in quantity, being removed, and the funnel
cleared, the chimney drew well, and gave satisfaction.</p>

<p>In general smoke is a very tractable thing, easily governed
and directed when one knows the principles,
and is well informed of the circumstances. You know
I made it <em>descend</em> in my Pensylvania stove. I formerly
had a more simple construction, in which the same effect
was produced, but visible to the eye (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure
7). It was composed of two plates A B and C D,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
placed as in the figure. The lower plate A B rested
with its edge in the angle made by the hearth with the
back of the chimney. The upper plate was fixed to the
breast, and lapped over the lower about six inches wide
and the length of the plates (near two feet) between
them. Every other passage of air into the funnel was
well stopped. When therefore a fire was made at E,
for the first time with charcoal, till the air in the funnel
was a little heated through the plates, and then wood
laid on, the smoke would rise to A, turn over the edge
of that plate, descend to D, then turn under the edge
of the upper plate, and go up the chimney. It was
pretty to see, but of no great use. Placing therefore
the under plate in a higher situation, I removed the
upper plate C D, and placed it perpendicularly (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>,
Figure 8) so that the upper edge of the lower plate
A B came within about three inches of it, and might
be pushed farther from it, or suffered to come nearer
to it, by a moveable wedge between them. The
flame then ascending from the fire at E, was, carried
to strike the upper plate, made it very hot, and
its heat rose and spread with the rarefied air into
the room.</p>

<p>I believe you have seen in use with me, the contrivance
of a sliding-plate over the fire, seemingly placed
to oppose the rising of the smoke, leaving but a small
passage for it, between the edge of the plate and the
back of the chimney. It is particularly described, and
its uses explained, in my former printed letter, and I
mention it here only as another instance of the tractability
of smoke<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>
<p>What is called the Staffordshire chimney, (see the
<a href="#PLATE_VIII-A">Plate, facing page 238</a>) affords an example of the
same kind. The opening of the chimney is bricked
up, even with the fore-edge of its jams, leaving open
only a passage over the grate of the same width,
and perhaps eight inches high. The grate consists
of semicircular bars, their upper bar of the greatest
diameter, the others under it smaller and smaller, so
that it has the appearance of half a round basket. It
is, with the coals it contains, wholly without the wall
that shuts up the chimney, yet the smoke bends and
enters the passage above it, the draft being strong, because
no air can enter that is not obliged to pass
near or through the fire, so that all that the funnel is
filled with is much heated, and of course much rarefied.</p>

<p>Much more of the prosperity of a winter country depends
on the plenty and cheapness of fuel, than is generally
imagined. In travelling I have observed, that
in those parts where the inhabitants can have neither
wood nor coal nor turf but at excessive prices, the
working people live in miserable hovels, are ragged, and
have nothing comfortable about them. But when fuel
is cheap (or where they have the art of managing it to
advantage) they are well furnished with necessaries, and
have decent habitations. The obvious reason is, that
the working hours of such people are the profitable
hours, and they who cannot afford sufficient fuel have
fewer such hours in the twenty four, than those who
have it cheap and plenty: for much of the domestic
work of poor women, such as spinning, sewing, knitting;
and of the men in those manufactures that require
little bodily exercise, cannot well be performed
where the fingers are numbed with cold, those people,
therefore, in cold weather, are induced to go to bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
sooner, and lie longer in a morning, than they would
do if they could have good fires or warm stoves to sit
by; and their hours of work are not sufficient to produce
the means of comfortable subsistence. Those
public works, therefore, such as roads, canals, &amp;c. by
which fuel may be brought cheap into such countries
from distant places, are of great utility; and those who
promote them may be reckoned among the benefactors
of mankind.</p>

<p>I have great pleasure in having thus complied with
your request, and in the reflection, that the friendship
you honour me with, and in which I have ever been so
happy, has continued so many years without the smallest
interruption. Our distance from each other is now
augmented, and nature must soon put an end to the
possibility of my continuing our correspondence: but
if consciousness and memory remain in a future state,
my esteem and respect for you, my dear friend, will be
everlasting.</p>

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">TO J. B.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> ESQ. AT BOSTON, IN NEW-ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, Dec. 2, 1758,</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have executed here an easy simple contrivance,
that I have long since had in speculation, for keeping
rooms warmer in cold weather than they generally are,
and with less fire. It is this. The opening of the
chimney is contracted, by brick-work faced with marble
slabs, to about two feet between the jams, and the
breast brought down to within about three feet of the
hearth. An iron frame is placed just under the breast,
and extending quite to the back of the chimney, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>a plate of the same metal may slide horizontally backwards
and forwards in the grooves on each side of the
frame. This plate is just so large as to fill the whole
space, and shut the chimney entirely when thrust quite
in, which is convenient when there is no fire. Drawing
it out, so as to leave a space between its further edge
and the back, of about two inches; this space is sufficient
for the smoke to pass; and so large a part of the
funnel being stopt by the rest of the plate, the passage
of warm air out of the room, up the chimney, is obstructed
and retarded, and by that means much cold
air is prevented from coming in through crevices, to
supply its place. This effect is made manifest three
ways. First, when the fire burns briskly in cold weather,
the howling or whistling noise made by the wind,
as it enters the room through the crevices, when the
chimney is open as usual, ceases as soon as the plate is
slid in to its proper distance. Secondly, opening the
door of the room about half an inch, and holding your
hand against the opening, near the top of the door, you
feel the cold air coming in against your hand, but
weakly, if the plate be in. Let another person suddenly
draw it out, so as to let the air of the room go up the
chimney, with its usual freedom where chimneys are
open, and you immediately feel the cold air rushing in
strongly. Thirdly, if something be set against the
door, just sufficient, when the plate is in, to keep the
door nearly shut, by resisting the pressure of the air
that would force it open: then, when the plate is drawn
out, the door will be forced open by the increased pressure
of the outward cold air endeavouring to get in to
supply the place of the warm air, that now passes out of
the room to go up the chimney. In our common open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
chimneys, half the fuel is wasted, and its effect lost; the
air it has warmed being immediately drawn off. Several
of my acquaintance, having seen this simple machine
in my room, have imitated it at their own houses,
and it seems likely to become pretty common. I describe
it thus particularly to you, because I think it
would be useful in Boston, where firing is often dear.</p>

<p>Mentioning chimneys puts me in mind of a property
I formerly had occasion to observe in them, which I
have not found taken notice of by others; it is, that in
the summer time, when no fire is made in the chimneys,
there is, nevertheless, a regular draft of air through
them, continually passing upwards, from about five or
six o'clock in the afternoon, till eight or nine o'clock
the next morning, when the current begins to slacken
and hesitate a little, for about half an hour, and then
sets as strongly down again, which it continues to do
till towards five in the afternoon, then slackens and hesitates
as before, going sometimes a little up, then a
little down, till, in about a half an hour, it gets into a
steady upward current for the night, which continues
till eight or nine the next day; the hours varying a
little as the days lengthen and shorten, and sometimes
varying from sudden changes in the weather; as if,
after being long warm, it should begin to grow cool
about noon, while the air was coming down the chimney,
the current will then change earlier than the usual
hour, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This property in chimneys I imagine we might turn
to some account, and render improper, for the future,
the old saying, <em>as useless as a chimney in summer</em>. If the
opening of the chimney, from the breast down to the
hearth, be closed by a slight moveable frame or two, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the manner of doors, covered with canvas, that will let
the air through, but keep out the flies; and another little
frame set within upon the hearth, with hooks on
which to hang joints of meat, fowls, &amp;c. wrapt well in
wet linen cloths, three or four fold, I am confident, that
if the linen is kept wet, by sprinkling it once a day, the
meat would be so cooled by the evaporation, carried on
continually by means of the passing air, that it would
keep a week or more in the hottest weather. Butter
and milk might likewise be kept cool, in vessels or bottles
covered with wet cloths. A shallow tray, or keeler,
should be under the frame to receive any water that
might drip from the wetted cloths. I think, too, that
this property of chimneys might, by means of smoke-jack
vanes, be applied to some mechanical purposes,
where a small but pretty constant power only is
wanted.</p>

<p>If you would have my opinion of the cause of this
changing current of air in chimneys, it is, in short, as
follows. In summer time there is generally a great difference
in the warmth of the air at mid-day and mid-night,
and, of course, a difference of specific gravity in
the air, as the more it is warmed the more it is rarefied.
The funnel of a chimney, being for the most part surrounded
by the house, is protected, in a great measure,
from the direct action of the sun's rays, and also from
the coldness of the night air. It thence preserves a
middle temperature between the heat of the day, and
the coldness of the night. This middle temperature it
communicates to the air contained in it. If the state of
the outward air be cooler than that in the funnel of the
chimney, it will, by being heavier, force it to rise, and
go out at the top. What supplies its place from below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
being warmed, in its turn, by the warmer funnel, is likewise
forced up by the colder and weightier air below,
and so the current is continued till the next day, when
the sun gradually changes the state of the outward air,
makes it first as warm as the funnel of the chimney can
make it (when the current begins to hesitate) and afterwards
warmer. Then the funnel, being cooler than
the air that comes into it, cools that air, makes it
heavier than the outward air, of course it descends; and
what succeeds it from above being cooled in its turn,
the descending current continues till towards evening,
when it again hesitates and changes its course, from the
change of warmth in the outward air, and the nearly
remaining same middle temperature in the funnel.</p>

<p>Upon this principle, if a house were built behind
Beacon-hill, an adit carried from one of the doors into
the hill horizontally, till it meet with a perpendicular
shaft sunk from its top, it seems probable to me, that
those who lived in the house would constantly, in the
heat even of the calmest day, have as much cool air
passing through the house, as they should chuse; and
the same, though reversed in its current, during the stillest
night.</p>

<p>I think, too, this property might be made of use to
miners; as, where several shafts or pits are sunk perpendicularly
into the earth, communicating at bottom
by horizontal passages, which is a common case, if a
chimney of thirty or forty feet high were built over
one of the shafts, or so near the shaft, that the chimney
might communicate with the top of the shaft, all air
being excluded but what should pass up or down by the
shaft, a constant change of air would, by this means,
be produced in the passages below, tending to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the workmen from those damps, which so frequently
incommode them. For the fresh air would be almost
always going down the open shaft, to go up the chimney,
or down the chimney, to go up the shaft. Let me add
one observation more, which is, that if that part of the
funnel of a chimney, which appears above the roof of a
house, be pretty long, and have three of its sides exposed
to the heat of the sun successively, viz. when he is
in the east, in the south, and in the west, while the
north side is sheltered by the building from the cool
northerly winds; such a chimney will often be so heated
by the sun, as to continue the draft strongly upwards,
through the whole twenty-four hours, and often for
many days together. If the outside of such a chimney
be painted black, the effect will be still greater, and the
current stronger.</p>

<p>It is said the northern Chinese have a method of
warming their ground floors, which is ingenious. Those
floors are made of tiles, a foot square and two inches
thick, their corners being supported by bricks set on
end, that are a foot long and four inches square; the
tiles, too, join into each other, by ridges and hollows
along their sides. This forms a hollow under the whole
floor, which on one side of the house has an opening
into the air, where a fire is made, and it has a funnel
rising from the other side to carry off the smoke. The
fuel is a sulphurous pitcoal, the smell of which in the
room is thus avoided, while the floor, and of course the
room, is well warmed. But as the underside of the
floor must grow foul with soot, and a thick coat of soot
prevents much of the direct application of the hot air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to the tiles, I conceive that burning the smoke, by
obliging it to descend through red coals, would in this
construction be very advantageous, as more heat would
be given by the flame than by the smoke, and the floor
being thereby kept free from soot would be more heated
with less fire. For this purpose I would propose
erecting the funnel close to the grate, so as to have
only an iron plate between the fire and the funnel,
through which plate, the air in the funnel being heated,
it will be sure to draw well, and force the smoke to descend,
as in the figure (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure 9.) where A is
the funnel or chimney, B the grate on which the fire is
placed, C one of the apertures through which the descending
smoke is drawn into the channel D of figure
10, along which channel it is conveyed by a circuitous
route, as designated by the arrows, until it arrives at the
small aperture E, figure 10, through which it enters the
funnel F. G in both figures is the iron plate against
which the fire is made, which, being heated thereby,
will rarefy the air in that part of the funnel, and cause
the smoke to ascend rapidly. The flame thus dividing
from the grate to the right and left, and turning in passages,
disposed, as in <ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for Fig. 13, read Fig. 10'">figure 10</ins>, so as that every part of
the floor may be visited by it before it enters the funnel
F, by the two passages E E, very little of the heat will
be lost, and a winter room thus rendered very comfortable.</p>

<p>Page 265. <em>Few can imagine</em>, &amp;c. It is said the
Icelanders have very little fuel, chiefly drift wood that
comes upon their coast. To receive more advantage
from its heat, they make their doors low, and have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
stage round the room above the door, like a gallery,
wherein the women can sit and work, the men read or
write, &amp;c. The roof being tight, the warm air is confined
by it and kept from rising higher and escaping;
and the cold air, which enters the house when the door
is opened, cannot rise above the level of the top of the
door, because it is heavier than the warm air above the
door, and so those in the gallery are not incommoded
by it. Some of our too lofty rooms might have a stage
so constructed as to make a temporary gallery above,
for the winter, to be taken away in summer. Sedentary
people would find much comfort there in cold weather.</p>

<p class="center">No. V.</p>

<p>Page 285. <em>Where they have the art of managing it</em>,
&amp;c. In some houses of the lower people among the
northern nations of Europe, and among the poorer sort
of Germans in Pensylvania, I have observed this construction,
which appears very advantageous. (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>
Figure 11.) A is the kitchen with its chimney; B an
iron stove in the stove-room. In a corner of the chimney
is a hole through the back into the stove, to put in
fuel, and another hole above it to let the smoke of the
stove come back into the chimney. As soon as the
cooking is over, the brands in the kitchen chimney are
put through the hole to supply the stove, so that there
is seldom more than one fire burning at a time. In the
floor over the stove-room, is a small trap door, to let the
warm air rise occasionally into the chamber. Thus the
whole house is warmed at little expence of wood, and
the stove-room kept constantly warm; so that in the
coldest winter nights, they can work late, and find the
room still comfortable when they rise to work early.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
An English farmer in America, who makes great fires in
large open chimneys, needs the constant employment
of one man to cut and haul wood for supplying them;
and the draft of cold air to them is so strong, that the
heels of his family are frozen while they are scorching
their faces, and the room is never warm, so that little
sedentary work can be done by them in winter. The
difference in this article alone of economy shall, in a
course of years, enable the German to buy out the Englishman,
and take possession of his plantation.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Miscellaneous Observations.</em></p>

<p>Chimneys, whose funnels go up in the north wall
of a house and are exposed to the north winds, are not
so apt to draw well as those in a south wall; because,
when rendered cold by those winds, they draw downwards.</p>

<p>Chimneys, enclosed in the body of a house, are better
than those whose funnels are exposed in cold walls.</p>

<p>Chimneys in stacks are apt to draw better than separate
funnels, because the funnels, that have constant
fires in them, warm the others, in some degree, that have
none.</p>

<p>One of the funnels, in a house I once occupied, had
a particular funnel joined to the south side of the stack,
so that three of its sides were exposed to the sun in the
course of the day, viz. (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure 12.) the east
side E during the morning, the south side S in the middle
part of the day, and the west side W during the
afternoon, while its north side was sheltered by the stack
from the cold winds. This funnel, which came from
the ground-floor, and had a considerable height above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the roof, was constantly in a strong drawing state day
and night, winter and summer.</p>

<p>Blacking of funnels, exposed to the sun, would probably
make them draw still stronger.</p>

<p>In Paris I saw a fire-place so ingeniously contrived
as to serve conveniently two rooms, a bedchamber and
a study. The funnel over the fire was round. The
fire-place was of cast iron (<a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate</a>, Figure 13.) having
an upright back A, and two horizontal semicircular
plates B C, the whole so ordered as to turn on the
pivots D E. The plate B always stopped that part of
the round funnel that was next to the room without
fire, while the other half of the funnel over the fire was
always open. By this means a servant in the morning
could make a fire on the hearth C, then in the study,
without disturbing the master by going into his chamber;
and the master, when he rose, could, with a touch
of his foot, turn the chimney on its pivots, and bring the
fire into his chamber, keep it there as long as he wanted
it, and turn it again, when he went out, into his study.
The room which had no fire in it was also warmed by
the heat coming through the back plate, and spreading
in the room, as it could not go up the chimney.</p>

<p class="right padr4"><em>By Dr. B.</em> <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the last century an ingenious
French philosopher, whose name I am sorry I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>cannot recollect, exhibited an experiment to show, that
very offensive things might be burnt in the middle of a
chamber, such as woollen rags, feathers, &amp;c. without
creating the least smoke or smell. The machine in
which it was made, if I remember right, was of this
form, (<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate X.</a> Figure 1.) made of plate iron. Some
clear burning charcoals were put into the opening of
the short tube A, and supported there by the grate B.
The air, as soon as the tubes grew warm, would ascend
in the longer leg C and go out at D, consequently air
must enter at A descending to B. In this course it must
be heated by the burning coals through which it passed,
and rise more forcibly in the longer tube, in proportion
to its degree of heat or rarefaction, and length of that
tube. For such a machine is a kind of inverted syphon;
and as the greater weight of water in the longer
leg of a common syphon in descending is accompanied
by an ascent of the same fluid in the shorter; so, in
this inverted syphon, the greater quantity of levity of
air in the longer leg, in rising is accompanied by the
descent of air in the shorter. The things to be burned
being laid on the hot coals at A, the smoke must descend
through those coals, be converted into flame,
which, after destroying the offensive smell, came out
at the end of the longer tube as mere heated air.</p>

<p>Whoever would repeat this experiment with success
must take care that the part A, B, of the short tube, be
quite full of burning coals, so that no part of the smoke
may descend and pass by them without going through
them, and being converted into flame; and that the
longer tube be so heated as that the current of ascending
hot air is established in it before the things to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
burnt are laid on the coals; otherwise there will be a
disappointment.</p>

<p>It does not appear either in the Memoirs of the Academy
of Sciences, or Philosophical Transactions of the
English Royal Society, that any improvement was ever
made of this ingenious experiment, by applying it to
useful purposes. But there is a German book, entitled
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vulcanus Famulans</cite>, by Joh. George Leutmann, P. D.
printed at Wirtemberg in 1723, which describes,
among a great variety of other stoves for warming
rooms, one, which seems to have been formed on the
same principle, and probably from the hint thereby
given, though the French experiment is not mentioned.
This book being scarce, I have translated the
chapter describing the stove, viz.</p>

<p class="center">"CHAP. VII.</p>

<p class="pfs80">"On a Stove, which draws downwards.</p>

<p>"Here follows the description of a sort of stove,
which can easily be removed and again replaced at
pleasure. This drives the fire down under itself, and
gives no smoke, but however a very unwholesome vapour.</p>

<p>"In the figure, A is an iron vessel like a funnel,
(<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate X.</a> Figure 20.) in diameter at the top about
twelve inches, at the bottom near the grate about five
inches; its height twelve inches. This is set on the
barrel C, which is ten inches diameter and two feet
long, closed at each end E E. From one end rises a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
pipe or flue about four inches diameter, on which
other pieces of pipe are set, which are gradually contracted
to D, where the opening is but about two
inches. Those pipes must together be at least four
feet high. B is an iron grate. F F are iron handles
guarded with wood, by which the stove is to be lifted
and moved. It stands on three legs. Care must be
taken to stop well all the joints, that no smoke may
leak through.</p>

<p>"When this stove is to be used, it must first be carried
into the kitchen and placed in the chimney near
the fire. There burning wood must be laid and left
upon its grate till the barrel C is warm, and the smoke
no longer rises at A, but descends towards C. Then
it is to be carried into the room which it is to warm.
When once the barrel C is warm, fresh wood may be
thrown into the vessel A as often as one pleases, the
flame descends and without smoke, which is so consumed
that only a vapour passes out at D.</p>

<p>"As this vapour is unwholesome, and affects the
head, one may be freed from it, by fixing in the wall of
the room an inverted funnel, such as people use to hang
over lamps, through which their smoke goes out as
through a chimney. This funnel carries out all the vapour
cleverly, so that one finds no inconvenience from
it, even though the opening D be placed a span below
the mouth of the said funnel G. The neck of the funnel
is better when made gradually bending, than if
turned in a right angle.</p>

<p>"The cause of the draft downwards in the stove is
the pressure of the outward air, which, falling into the
vessel A in a column of twelve inches diameter, finds
only a resisting passage at the grate B, of five inches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and one at D, of two inches, which are much too weak
to drive it back again; besides, A stands much higher
than B, and so the pressure on it is greater and more
forcible, and beats down the frame to that part where it
finds the least resistance. Carrying the machine first
to the kitchen fire for preparation, is on this account,
that in the beginning the fire and smoke naturally ascend,
till the air in the close barrel C is made thinner
by the warmth. When that vessel is heated, the air in
it is rarefied, and then all the smoke and fire descends
under it.</p>

<p>"The wood should be thoroughly dry, and cut into
pieces five or six inches long, to fit it for being thrown
into the funnel A." Thus far the German book.</p>

<p>It appears to me, by Mr. Leutmann's explanation of
the operation of this machine, that he did not understand
the principles of it, whence I conclude he was
not the inventor of it; and by the description of it,
wherein the opening at A is made so large, and the
pipe E, D, so short, I am persuaded he never made nor
saw the experiment, for the first ought to be much
smaller and the last much higher, or it hardly will succeed.
The carrying it in the kitchen, too, every time
the fire should happen to be out, must be so troublesome,
that it is not likely ever to have been in practice,
and probably has never been shown but as a philosophical
experiment. The funnel for conveying the vapour
out of the room would besides have been uncertain
in its operation, as a wind blowing against its
mouth would drive the vapour back.</p>

<p>The stove I am about to describe was also formed
on the idea given by the French experiment, and completely
carried into execution before I had any know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>ledge
of the German invention; which I wonder
should remain so many years in a country, where men
are so ingenious in the management of fire, without receiving
long since the improvements I have given it.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Description of the Parts.</em></p>

<p>A, the bottom plate which lies flat upon the hearth,
with its partitions, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, (<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate X.</a> Figure 2.)
that are cast with it, and a groove Z Z, in which are to
slide, the bottom edges of the small plates Y, Y, figure
12; which plates meeting at X close the front.</p>

<p>B 1, figure 3, is the cover plate showing its under
side, with the grooves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, to receive the top
edges of the partitions that are fixed to the bottom
plate. It shows also the grate W W, the bars of which
are cast in the plate, and a groove V V, which comes
right over the groove Z Z, figure 2, receiving the upper
edges of the small sliding plates Y Y, figure 12.</p>

<p>B 2, figure 4, shows the upper side of the same plate,
with a square impression or groove for receiving the
bottom mouldings T T T T of the three-sided box C,
figure 5, which is cast in one piece.</p>

<p>D, figure 6, its cover, showing its under side with
grooves to receive the upper edges S S S of the sides
of C, figure 5, also a groove R, R, which when the cover
is put on comes right over another Q Q in C, figure
5, between which it is to slide.</p>

<p>E, figure 7, the front plate of the box.</p>

<p>P, a hole three inches diameter through the cover D,
figure 6, over which hole stands the vase F, figure 8,
which has a corresponding hole two inches diameter
through its bottom.</p>

<p>The top of the vase opens at O, O, O, figure 8, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
turns back upon a hinge behind when coals are to be
put in; the vase has a grate within at N N of cast iron
H, figure 9, and a hole in the top, one and a half inches
diameter, to admit air, and to receive the ornamental
brass guilt flame M, figure 10, which stands in that
hole, and, being itself hollow and open, suffers air to
pass through it to the fire.</p>

<p>G, figure 11, is a drawer of plate iron, that slips in
between in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'partions'">partitions</ins> 2 and 3, figure 2, to receive the
falling ashes. It is concealed when the small sliding
plates Y Y, figure 12, are shut together.</p>

<p>I, I, I, I, figure 8, is a niche built of brick in the
chimney and plastered. It closes the chimney over
the vase, but leaves two funnels, one in each corner,
communicating with the bottom box K K, figure 2.</p>

<p class="center"><em>To fix this Machine.</em></p>

<p>Spread mortar on the hearth to bed the bottom plate
A, then lay that plate level, equally distant from each
jamb, and projecting out as far as you think proper.
Then putting some Windsor loam in the grooves of the
cover B, lay that on: trying the sliding plates Y Y, to
see if they move freely in the grooves Z Z, V V, designed
for them.</p>

<p>Then begin to build the niche, observing to leave the
square corners of the chimney unfilled; for they are to
be funnels. And observe also to leave a free open
communication between the passages at K K, and the
bottom of those funnels, and mind to close the chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
above the top of the niche, that no air may pass up
that way. The concave back of the niche will rest
on the circular iron partition 1 A 4, figure 2, then,
with a little loam, put on the box C over the grate, the
open side of the box in front.</p>

<p>Then, with loam in three of its grooves, the groove
R R being left clean, and brought directly over the
groove Q Q in the box, put on the cover D, trying
the front plate E, to see if it slides freely in those
grooves.</p>

<p>Lastly, set on the vase, which has small holes in the
moulding of its bottom to receive two iron pins that rise
out of the plate D at I I, for the better keeping it
steady.</p>

<p>Then putting in the grate H, which rests on its three
knobs h h h against the inside of the vase, and slipping
the drawer into its place; the machine is fit for
use.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="center"><em>To use it.</em></p>

<p>Let the first fire be made after eight in the evening
or before eight in the morning, for at those times and
between those hours all night, there is usually a draft
up a chimney, though it has long been without fire;
but between those hours in the day there is often, in a
cold chimney, a draft downwards, when, if you attempt
to kindle a fire, the smoke will come into the room.</p>

<p>But to be certain of your proper time, hold a flame
over the air-hole at the top. If the flame is drawn
strongly down for a continuance, without whiffling,
you may begin to kindle a fire.</p>

<p>First put in a few charcoals on the grate H.</p>

<p>Lay some small sticks on the charcoals,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Lay some pieces of paper on the sticks,</p>

<p>Kindle the paper with a candle,</p>

<p>Then shut down the top, and the air will pass down
through the air-hole, blow the flame of the paper down
through the sticks, kindle them, and their flame passing
lower kindles the charcoal.</p>

<p>When the charcoal is well kindled, lay on it the sea-coals,
observing not to choak the fire by putting on too
much at first.</p>

<p>The flame descending through the hole in the bottom
of the vase, and that in plate D into the box C,
passes down farther through the grate W W in plate
B 1, then passes horizontally towards the back of the
chimney; there dividing, and turning to the right and
left, one part of it passes round the far end of the partition
2, then coming forward it turns round the near
end of partition 1, then moving backward it arrives at
the opening into the bottom of one of the upright corner
funnels behind the niche, through which it ascends into
the chimney, thus heating that half of the box and that
side of the niche. The other part of the divided flame
passes round the far end of partition 3, round the near
end of partition 4, and so into and up the other corner
funnel, thus heating the other half of the box, and the
other side of the niche. The vase itself, and the box
C will also be very hot, and the air surrounding them
being heated, and rising, as it cannot get into the
chimney, it spreads in the room, colder air succeeding
is warmed in its turn, rises and spreads, till by the continual
circulation the whole is warmed.</p>

<p>If you should have occasion to make your first fire at
hours not so convenient as those above mentioned, and
when the chimney does not draw, do not begin it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
vase, but in one or more of the passages of the lower
plate, first covering the mouth of the vase. After the
chimney has drawn a while with the fire thus low, and
begins to be a little warm, you may close those passages
and kindle another fire in the box C, leaving its sliding
shutter a little open; and when you find after some
time that the chimney being warmed draws forcibly,
you may shut that passage, open your vase, and kindle
your fire there, as above directed. The chimney well
warmed by the first day's fire will continue to draw constantly
all winter, if fires are made daily.</p>

<p>You will, in the management of your fire, have need
of the following implements:</p>

<p>A pair of small light tongs, twelve or fifteen inches
long, <a href="#PLATE_X">plate</a>, figure 13.</p>

<p>A light poker about the same length with a flat broad
point, figure 14.</p>

<p>A rake to draw ashes out of the passages of the lower
plate, where the lighter kind escaping the ash-box will
gather by degrees, and perhaps once in a week or ten
days require being removed, figure 15.</p>

<p>And a fork with its prongs wide enough to slip on
the neck of the vase cover, in order to raise and open it
when hot, to put in fresh coals, figure 16.</p>

<p>In the management of this stove there are certain
precautions to be observed, at first with attention, till
they become habitual. To avoid the inconvenience of
smoke, see that the grate H be clear before you begin
to light a fresh fire. If you find it clogged with cinders
and ashes, turn it up with your tongs and let them
fall upon the grate below; the ashes will go through it,
and the cinders may be raked off and returned into the
vase when you would burn them. Then see that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
sliding plates are in their places and close shut, that no
air may enter the stove but through the round opening
at the top of the vase. And to avoid the inconvenience
of dust from the ashes, let the ash-drawer be taken out
of the room to be emptied; and when you rake the
passages, do it when the draft of the air is strong inwards,
and put the ashes carefully into the ash-box,
that remaining in its place.</p>

<p>If, being about to go abroad, you would prevent your
fire burning in your absence, you may do it by taking
the brass flame from the top of the vase, and covering
the passage with a round tin plate, which will prevent
the entry of more air than barely sufficient to keep a
few of the coals alive. When you return, though some
hours absent, by taking off the tin plate and admitting
the air, your fire will soon be recovered.</p>

<p>The effect of this machine, well managed, is to burn
not only the coals, but all the smoke of the coals, so
that while the fire is burning, if you go out and observe
the top of your chimney, you will see no smoke issuing,
nor any thing but clear warm air, which as usual makes
the bodies seen through it appear waving.</p>

<p>But let none imagine from this, that it may be a cure
for bad or smoky chimneys, much less, that as it burns
the smoke it may be used in a room that has no chimney.
It is by the help of a good chimney, the higher
the better, that it produces its effect; and though a flue
of plate iron sufficiently high might be raised in a very
lofty room, the management to prevent all disagreeable
vapour would be too nice for common practice, and
small errors would have unpleasing consequences.</p>

<p>It is certain that clean iron yields no offensive smell
when heated. Whatever of that kind you perceive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
where there are iron stoves, proceeds therefore from
some foulness burning or fuming on their surface.
They should therefore never be spit upon, or greased,
nor should any dust be suffered to lie upon them. But
as the greatest care will not always prevent these things,
it is well once a week to wash the stove with soap lees
and a brush, rinsing it with clean water.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="center"><em>The Advantages of this Stove.</em></p>

<p>1. The chimney does not grow foul, nor ever need
sweeping; for as no smoke enters it, no soot can form
in it.</p>

<p>2. The air heated over common fires instantly quits
the room and goes up the chimney with the smoke; but
in the stove, it is obliged to descend in flame and pass
through the long winding horizontal passages, communicating
its heat to a body of iron plate, which, having
thus time to receive the heat, communicates the same
to the air of the room, and thereby warms it to a greater
degree.</p>

<p>3. The whole of the fuel is consumed by being turned
into flame, and you have the benefit of its heat, whereas
in common chimneys a great part goes away in smoke
which you see as it rises, but it affords you no rays of
warmth. One may obtain some notion of the quantity
of fuel thus wasted in smoke, by reflecting on the quantity
of soot that a few weeks firing will lodge against the
sides of the chimney, and yet this is formed only of
those particles of the column of smoke that happen to
touch the sides in its ascent. How much more must
have passed off in the air? And we know that this soot
is still fuel; for it will burn and flame as such, and when
hard caked together is indeed very like and almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
solid as the coal it proceeds from. The destruction of
your fuel goes on nearly in the same quantity whether
in smoke or in flame: but there is no comparison in
the difference of heat given. Observe when fresh coals
are first put on your fire, what a body of smoke arises.
This smoke is for a long time too cold to take flame.
If you then plunge a burning candle into it, the candle
instead of inflaming the smoke will instantly be itself
extinguished. Smoke must have a certain degree of
heat to be inflammable. As soon as it has acquired
that degree, the approach of a candle will inflame the
whole body, and you will be very sensible of the difference
of the heat it gives. A still easier experiment
may be made with the candle itself. Hold your hand
near the side of its flame, and observe the heat it gives;
then blow it out, the hand remaining in the same place,
and observe what heat may be given by the smoke that
rises from the still burning snuff. You will find it very
little. And yet that smoke has in it the substance of
so much flame, and will instantly produce it, if you hold
another candle above it so as to kindle it. Now the
smoke from the fresh coals laid on this stove, instead of
ascending and leaving the fire while too cold to burn,
being obliged to descend through the burning coals,
receives among them that degree of heat which converts
it into flame, and the heat of that flame is communicated
to the air of the room, as above explained.</p>

<p>4. The flame from the fresh coals laid on in this
stove, descending through the coals already ignited,
preserves them long from consuming, and continues
them in the state of red coals as long as the flame
continues that surrounds them, by which means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the fires made in this stove are of much longer duration
than in any other, and fewer coals are therefore necessary
for a day. This is a very material advantage indeed.
That flame should be a kind of pickle, to preserve
burning coals from consuming, may seem a paradox
to many, and very unlikely to be true, as it appeared
to me the first time I observed the fact. I must
therefore relate the circumstances, and shall mention
an easy experiment, by which my reader may be in possession
of every thing necessary to the understanding
of it. In the first trial I made of this kind of stove,
which was constructed of thin plate iron, I had instead
of the vase a kind of inverted pyramid like a mill-hopper;
and fearing at first that the small grate contained
in it might be clogged by cinders, and the passage of
the flame sometimes obstructed, I ordered a little door
near the grate, by means of which I might on occasion
clear it: though after the stove was made, and before
I tried it, I began to think this precaution superfluous,
from an imagination, that the flame being contracted in
the narrow part where the grate was placed, would be
more powerful in consuming what it should there meet
with, and that any cinders between or near the bars
would be presently destroyed and the passage opened.
After the stove was fixed and in action, I had a pleasure
now and then in opening that door a little, to see
through the crevice how the flame descended among
the red coals, and observing once a single coal lodged
on the bars in the middle of the focus, a fancy took me
to observe by my watch in how short a time it would
be consumed. I looked at it long without perceiving
it to be at all diminished, which surprised me greatly.
At length it occurred to me, that I and many others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
had seen the same thing thousands of times, in the conservation
of the red coal formed in the snuff of a burning
candle, which while envelloped in flame, and
thereby prevented from the contact of passing air, is
long continued and augments instead of diminishing,
so that we are often obliged to remove it by the snuffers,
or bend it out of the flame into the air, where it
consumes presently to ashes. I then supposed, that to
consume a body by fire, passing air was necessary to
receive and carry off the separated particles of the
body: and that the air passing in the flame of my
stove, and in the flame of a candle, being already saturated
with such particles, could not receive more, and
therefore left the coal undiminished as long as the outward
air was prevented from coming to it by the surrounding
flame, which kept it in a situation somewhat
like that of charcoal in a well luted crucible, which,
though long kept in a strong fire, comes out unconsumed.</p>

<p>An easy experiment will satisfy any one of this conserving
power of flame envelloping red coal. Take a
small stick of deal or other wood the size of a goose
quill, and hold it horizontally and steadily in the flame
of the candle above the wick, without touching it, but
in the body of the flame. The wood will first be inflamed,
and burn beyond the edge of the flame of the
candle, perhaps a quarter of an inch. When the flame
of the wood goes out, it will leave a red coal at the end
of the stick, part of which will be in the flame of the
candle and part out in the air. In a minute or two you
will perceive the coal in the air diminish gradually, so
as to form a neck; while the part in the flame continues
of its first size, and at length the neck being quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
consumed it drops off; and by rolling it between your
fingers when extinguished you will find it still a solid
coal.</p>

<p>However, as one cannot be always putting on fresh
fuel in this stove to furnish a continual flame as is done
in a candle, the air in the intervals of time gets at the
red coals and consumes them. Yet the conservation
while it lasted, so much delayed the consumption of the
coals, that two fires, one made in the morning, and the
other in the afternoon, each made by only a hatfull of
coals, were sufficient to keep my writing room, about
sixteen feet square and ten high, warm a whole day.
The fire kindled at seven in the morning would burn
till noon; and all the iron of the machine with the walls
of the niche being thereby heated, the room kept warm
till evening, when another smaller fire kindled kept it
warm till midnight.</p>

<p>Instead of the sliding plate E, which shuts the front
of the box C, I sometimes used another which had a
pane of glass, or, which is better, of Muscovy talc, that
the flame might be seen descending from the bottom
of the vase and passing in a column through the box
C, into the cavities of the bottom plate, like water falling
from a funnel, admirable to such as are not acquainted
with the nature of the machine, and in itself
a pleasing spectacle.</p>

<p>Every utensil, however properly contrived to serve
its purpose, requires some practice before it can be used
adroitly. Put into the hands of a man for the first
time a gimblet or a hammer (very simple instruments)
and tell him the use of them, he shall neither bore a
hole or drive a nail with the dexterity and success of
another who has been accustomed to handle them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
The beginner therefore in the use of this machine will
do well not to be discouraged with little accidents that
may arise at first from his want of experience. Being
somewhat complex, it requires as already said a variety
of attentions; habit will render them unnecessary. And
the studious man who is much in his chamber, and has
a pleasure in managing his own fire, will soon find this
a machine most comfortable and delightful. To others
who leave their fires to the care of ignorant servants, I
do not recommend it. They will with difficulty acquire
the knowledge necessary, and will make frequent
blunders that will fill your room with smoke. It is
therefore by no means fit for common use in families.
It may be adviseable to begin with the flaming kind of
stone coal, which is large, and, not caking together, is
not so apt to clog the grate. After some experience,
any kind of coal may be used, and with this advantage,
that no smell, even from the most sulphurous kind can
come into your room, the current of air being constantly
into the vase, where too that smell is all consumed.</p>

<p>The vase form was chosen as being elegant in itself,
and very proper for burning of coals: where wood is
the usual fuel, and must be burned in pieces of some
length, a long square chest may be substituted, in which
A is the cover opening by a hinge behind, B the grate,
C the hearth-box with its divisions as in the other, D
the plan of the chest, E the long narrow grate. (<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate</a>,
Figure 17.) This I have not tried, but the vase machine
was completed in 1771, and used by me in London
three winters, and one afterwards in America, much to
my satisfaction; and I have not yet thought of any improvement
it may be capable of, though such may occur
to others. For common use, while in France, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
have contrived another grate for coals, which has in
part the same property of burning the smoke and preserving
the red coals longer by the flame, though not
so completely as in the vase, yet sufficiently to be very
useful, which I shall now describe as follows.</p>

<p>A, is a round grate, one foot (French) in diameter,
and eight inches deep between the bars and the back;
(<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate</a>, Figure 18.) the sides and back of plate iron;
the sides having holes of half an inch diameter distant
three or four inches from each other, to let in air for
enlivening the fire. The back without holes. The sides
do not meet at top nor at bottom by eight inches: that
square is filled by grates of small bars crossing front to
back to let in air below, and let out the smoke or flame
above. The three middle bars of the front grate are
fixed, the upper and lower may be taken out and put in
at pleasure, when hot, with a pair of pincers. This
round grate turns upon, an axis, supported by the
crotchet B, the stem of which is an inverted conical
tube five inches deep, which comes on as many inches
upon a pin that fits it, and which is fixed upright in
cast iron plate D, that lies upon the hearth; in the
middle of the top and bottom grates are fixed small upright
pieces E E about an inch high, which as the
whole is turned on its axis stop it when the grate is
perpendicular. Figure 19 is another view of the same
machine.</p>

<p>In making the first fire in a morning with this grate,
there is nothing particular to be observed. It is made
as in other grates, the coals being put in above, after
taking out the upper bar, and replacing it when they
are in. The round figure of the fire when thoroughly
kindled is agreeable, it represents the great giver of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
warmth to our system. As it burns down and leaves a
vacancy above, which you would fill with fresh coals,
the upper bar is to be taken out, and afterwards replaced.
The fresh coals, while the grate continues in
the same position, will throw up as usual a body of
thick smoke. But every one accustomed to coal fires
in common grates must have observed, that pieces of
fresh coal stuck in below among the red coals have their
smoke so heated as that it becomes flame as fast as it is
produced, which flame rises among the coals and enlivens
the appearance of the fire. Here then is the use
of this swivel grate. By a push with your tongs or poker,
you turn it on its pin till it faces the back of the
chimney, then turn it over on its axis gently till it again
faces the room, whereby all the fresh coals will be found
under the live coals, and the greater part of the smoke
arising from the fresh coals will in its passage through
the live ones be heated so as to be converted into
flame: whence you have much more heat from them,
and your red coals are longer preserved from consuming.
I conceive this construction, though not so complete
a consumer of all the smoke as the vase, yet to be
fitter for common use, and very advantageous. It gives
too a full sight of the fire, always a pleasing object,
which we have not in the other. It may with a touch
be turned more or less from any one of the company
that desires to have less of its heat, or presented full to
one just come out of the cold. And supported in a
horizontal position, a tea-kettle may be boiled on it.</p>

<p>The author's description of his Pensylvania fireplace,
first published in 1744, having fallen into the
hands of workmen in Europe, who did not, it seems,
well comprehend the principles of that machine, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
much disfigured in their imitations of it; and one of
its main intentions, that of admitting a sufficient quantity
of fresh air warmed in entering through the air-box,
nearly defeated, by a pretended improvement, in
lessening its passages to make more room for coals in a
grate. On pretence of such improvements, they obtained
patents for the invention, and for a while made
great profit by the sale, till the public became sensible
of that defect, in the expected operation. If the same
thing should be attempted with this vase stove, it will
be well for the buyer to examine thoroughly such pretended
improvements, lest, being the mere productions
of ignorance, they diminish or defeat the advantages
of the machine, and produce inconvenience and disappointment.</p>

<p>The method of burning smoke, by obliging it to descend
through hot coals, may be of great use in heating
the walls of a hot-house. In the common way, the
horizontal passages or flues that are made to go and
return in those walls, lose a great deal of their effect
when they come to be foul with soot; for a thick
blanket-like lining of soot prevents much of the hot air
from touching and heating the brick work in its passage,
so that more fire must be made as the flue grows
fouler: but by burning the smoke they are kept always
clean. The same method may also be of great advantage
to those businesses in which large coppers or caldrons
are to be heated.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Method of Contracting Chimneys. Modesty in Disputation.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven-Street, Saturday Evening, past 10.</em></p>

<p>The question you ask me is a very sensible one,
and I shall be glad if I can give you a satisfactory answer.
There are two ways of contracting a chimney;
one, by contracting the opening <em>before</em> the fire; the
other, by contracting the funnel <em>above</em> the fire. If the
funnel above the fire is left open in its full dimensions,
and the opening before the fire is contracted; then the
coals, I imagine, will burn faster, because more air is
directed through the fire, and in a stronger stream;
that air which before passed over it, and on each side
of it, now passing <em>through</em> it. This is seen in narrow
stove chimneys, when a sacheverell or blower is used,
which still more contracts the narrow opening.&mdash;But
if the funnel only <em>above</em> the fire is contracted, then, as a
less stream of air is passing up the chimney, less must
pass through the fire, and consequently it should seem
that the consuming of the coals would rather be checked
than augmented by such contraction. And this will
also be the case, when both the opening <em>before</em> the fire,
and the funnel <em>above</em> the fire are contracted, provided
the funnel above the fire is more contracted in proportion
than the opening before the fire.&mdash;So you see I
think you had the best of the argument; and as you
notwithstanding gave it up in complaisance to the company,
I think you had also the best of the dispute.
There are few, though convinced, that know how to
give up, even an error, they have been once engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
maintaining; there is therefore the more merit in
dropping a contest where one thinks one's self right;
it is at least respectful to those we converse with. And
indeed all our knowledge is so imperfect, and we are
from a thousand causes so perpetually subject to mistake
and error, that positiveness can scarce ever become
even the most knowing; and modesty in advancing
any opinion, however plain and true we may suppose
it, is always <ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for descent, read decent'">decent</ins>, and generally more likely to procure
assent. Pope's rule</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">To speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence,</p>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, March 17, 1770.</em></p>

<p class="smcap">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I received your favour of November 25, and
have made enquiries, as you desired, concerning the
copper covering of houses. It has been used here in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
few instances only, and the practice does not seem to
gain ground. The copper is about the thickness of a
common playing card, and though a dearer metal than
lead, I am told, that, as less weight serves, on account
of its being so much thinner, and as slighter woodwork
in the roof is sufficient to support it, the roof is not
dearer on the whole, than one covered with lead. It is
said, that hail and rain make a disagreeable drumming
noise on copper; but this I suppose is rather fancy;
for the plates being fastened on the rafters, must, in a
great measure, deaden such sound. The first cost,
whatever it is, will be all, as a copper covering must
last for ages; and when the house decays, the plates
will still have intrinsic worth. In Russia, I am informed
many houses are covered with plates of iron tinned,
such as our tin pots and other vases are made of, laid
on over the edges of one another like tiles; and which,
it is said, last very long, the tin preserving the iron from
much decay by rusting. In France and the Low
Countries, I have seen many spouts or pipes for conveying
the water down from the roofs of houses, made
of the same kind of tin plates soldered together; and
they seem to stand very well.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the same Subject.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, June 26, 1770.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Friend,</p>

<p>It is a long time since I had the pleasure of hearing
from you directly. Mrs. Franklin has indeed now and
then acquainted me of your welfare, which I am always
glad to hear of. It is, I fear, partly, if not altogether,
my fault, that our correspondence has not been regularly
continued. One thing I am sure of, that it has been
from no want of regard on either side, but rather from
too much business, and avocations of various kinds, and
my having little of importance to communicate.</p>

<p>One of our good citizens, Mr. Hillegras, anxious for
the future safety of our town, wrote to me some time
since, desiring I would enquire concerning the covering
of our houses here with copper. I sent him the best
information I could then obtain, but have since received
the inclosed from an ingenious friend, who is what they
call here a civil engineer. I should be glad you would
peruse it, think of the matter a little and give me your
sentiments of it. When you have done with the paper,
please to give it to Mr. Hillegras. I am told by Lord
Despencer, who has covered a long piazza, or gallery,
with copper, that the expence is charged in this account
too high, for his cost but one shilling and ten-pence
per foot, all charges included. I suppose his
copper must have been thinner. And, indeed, it is so
strong a metal, that I think it may well be used very
thin.</p>

<p>It appears to me of great importance, to build our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
dwelling houses, if we can, in a manner more secure
from danger by fire. We scarcely ever hear of fire in
Paris. When I was there I took particular notice of
the construction of their houses, and I did not see how
one of them could well be burnt, the roofs are slate or
tile, the walls are stone, the walls generally lined with
stucco or plaster, instead of wainscot, the floors of stucco,
or of six square tiles painted brown, or of flag stone,
or of marble; if any floors were of wood, it was of oak
wood, which is not so inflammable as pine. Carpets
prevent the coldness of stone or brick floors offending
the feet in winter, and the noise of treading on such
floors, overhead, is less inconvenient than on boards.
The stairs too, at Paris, are either stone or brick, with
only a wooden edge or corner for the step; so that on
the whole, though the Parisians commonly burn wood
in their chimneys, a more dangerous kind of fuel than
that used here, yet their houses escape extremely well,
as there is little in a room that can be consumed by
fire except the furniture: whereas in London, perhaps
scarcely a year passes in which half a million of property
and many lives are not lost by this destructive
element. Of late, indeed, they begin here to leave off
wainscoting their rooms, and instead of it cover the
walls with stucco, often formed into pannels like wainscot,
which being painted, is very strong and warm.
Stone staircases too, with iron rails, grow more and
more into fashion here: but stone steps cannot, in
some circumstances, be fixed; and there, methinks,
oak is safer than pine; and I assure you, that in many
genteel houses here, both old and new, the stairs and
floors are oak, and look extremely well. Perhaps solid
oak for the steps would be still safer than boards; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
two steps might be cut diagonally out of one piece.
Excuse my talking to you on a subject with which you
must be so much better acquainted than I am. It is
partly to make out a letter, and partly in hope, that,
by turning your attention to the point, some methods
of greater security in our future building may be
thought of and promoted by you, whose judgment I
know has deservedly great weight with our fellow-citizens.
For though our town has not hitherto suffered
very greatly by fire, yet I am apprehensive, that some
time or other, by a concurrence of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'unluckly'">unlucky</ins> circumstances,
such as dry weather, hard frost, and high
winds, a fire then happening may suddenly spread far
and wide over our cedar roofs, and do us an immense
mischief. I am,</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Paper referred to in the preceding Letter.</em></a></h3>

<p>The carpentry of the roof being formed with its
proper descents, is, in the first place, sheeted or covered
with deals, nailed horizontally upon the rafters, after
the same manner as when intended to be covered with
lead. The sheets of the copper for this covering are
two feet by four, and for covering the slopes of the
roof are cast so thin, as to weigh eight or nine pounds,
and for covering the flats or gutters, ten or eleven
pounds each, or about one pound, or a pound and a
quarter, to the superficial foot.</p>

<p>A string of strong cartridge paper (over-lapping a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
little at its joints) is regularly tacked down upon the
sheeting, under the copper covering, as the work proceeds
from eaves to ridge. It prevents the jingling
sound of hail or rain falling upon the roof, and answers
another purpose to be mentioned by-and-by.</p>

<p>In order to shew the regular process of laying down
the roof, we must begin with fastening two sheets together
lengthwise. The edges of two sheets are laid
down so as to lap or cover each other an inch, and a
slip of the same copper, about three and a half inches
broad, called the reeve, is introduced between them.
Four oblong holes, or slits, are then cut or punched
through the whole, and they are fastened or riveted
together by copper nails, with small round shanks and
flat heads. Indents are then cut 1¾ inch deep upon
the seam at top and bottom. The right hand sheet
and the reeve are then folded back to the left. The
reeve is then folded to the right, and the sheets being
laid on the roof in their place, it is nailed down to the
sheeting with flat-headed short copper nails. The
right hand sheet is then folded over the reeve to the
right, and the whole beat down flat upon the cartridge
paper covering the sheeting, and thus they are fastened
and laid in their places, by nailing down the reeve only;
and by reason of the oblong holes through them and
the reeve, have a little liberty to expand or contract
with the heat and cold, without raising themselves up
from the sheeting, or tearing themselves or the fastening
to pieces. Two other sheets are then fixed together,
according to the first and second operations above,
and their seam, with the reeve, introduced under the
upper ends of the seam of the former, so as to cover
down about two inches upon the upper ends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
former sheets: and so far the cartridge paper is allowed
to cover the two first sheets. This edge of the
paper is dipped in oil, or in turpentine, so far before
its application, and thus a body between the sheets is
formed impenetrable to wet, and the reeve belonging
to the two last sheets is nailed down to the sheeting as
before, and the left hand sheet is turned down to the
right. Four sheets are now laid down, with the seam
or joint rising to the ridge; and thus the work is continued,
both vertically and horizontally, till the roof be
covered, the sides and ends of each sheet being alternately
each way, undermost and uppermost.</p>

<p>The price for copper, nails, and workmanship, runs
at about eight pounds ten shillings per hundred weight,
or two shillings and three-pence per foot, superficial,
exclusive of the lappings; and about two shillings and
eight-pence per foot upon the whole; which is rather
above half as much more as the price of doing it well
with lead.</p>

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">TO PETER COLLINSON, ESQ. AT LONDON.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Magical Square of Squares.</em></a></h3>

<p class="smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p>According to your request I now send you the
arithmetical curiosity, of which this is the history.</p>

<p>Being one day in the country, at the house of our
common friend, the late learned Mr. Logan, he showed
me a folio French book filled with magic squares,
wrote, if I forget not, by one M. Frenicle, in which
he said the author had discovered great ingenuity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
dexterity in the management of numbers; and though
several other foreigners had distinguished themselves
in the same way, he did not recollect that any one
Englishman had done any thing of the kind remarkable.</p>

<p>I said, it was, perhaps, a mark of the good sense of
our English mathematicians, that they would not spend
their time in things that were merely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">difficiles nugæ</i>, incapable
of any useful application. He answered, that
many of the arithmetical or mathematical questions,
publicly proposed and answered in England, were
equally trifling and useless. Perhaps the considering
and answering such questions, I replied, may not be
altogether useless, if it produces by practice an habitual
readiness and exactness in mathematical disquisitions,
which readiness may, on many occasions, be of real
use. In the same way, says he, may the making of
these squares be of use. I then confessed to him, that
in my younger days, having once some leisure (which
I still think I might have employed more usefully) I
had amused myself in making these kind of magic
squares, and, at length, had acquired such a knack at
it, that I could fill the cells of any magic square of reasonable
size, with a series of numbers as fast as I could
write them, disposed in such a manner as that the sums
of every row, horizontal, perpendicular, or diagonal,
should be equal; but not being satisfied with these,
which I looked on as common and easy things, I had
imposed on myself more difficult tasks, and succeeded
in making other magic squares, with a variety of properties,
and much more curious. He then shewed me
several in the same book, of an uncommon and more
curious kind; but as I thought none of them equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
some I remembered to have made, he desired me to let
him see them; and accordingly, the next time I visited
him, I carried him a square of 8, which I found among
my old papers, and which I will now give you, with an
account of its properties. (<a href="#PLATE_V"><ins class="corr" title="Errata applied: 'for Plate XI, read Plate V. Fig. 3.'"><em>See Plate</em> V. Fig. 3.</ins></a>)</p>

<p>The properties are,</p>

<p>1. That every strait row (horizontal or vertical) of 8
numbers added together makes 260, and half each row
half 260.</p>

<p>2. That the bent row of 8 numbers, ascending and
descending diagonally, viz. from 16 ascending to 10,
and from 23 descending to 17; and every one of its
parallel bent rows of 8 numbers make 260.&mdash;Also the
bent row from 52 descending to 54, and from 43 ascending
to 45; and every one of its parallel bent rows
of 8 numbers make 260.&mdash;Also the bent row from 45
to 43, descending to the left, and from 23 to 17, descending
to the right, and every one of its parallel bent
rows of 8 numbers, make 260.&mdash;Also the bent row from
52 to 54, descending to the right, and from 10 to 16,
descending to the left, and every one of its parallel bent
rows of 8 numbers make 260.&mdash;Also the parallel bent
rows next to the above-mentioned, which are shortened
to 3 numbers ascending, and 3 descending, &amp;c. as
from 53 to 4 ascending, and from 29 to 44 descending,
make, with the two corner numbers, 260.&mdash;Also the 2
numbers 14, 61 ascending, and 36, 19 descending, with
the lower 4 numbers situated like them, viz. 50, 1, descending,
and 32, 47, ascending, make 260.&mdash;And,
lastly, the 4 corner numbers, with the 4 middle numbers,
make 260.</p>

<p>So this magical square seems perfect in its kind.
But these are not all its properties; there are 5 other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>curious ones, which, at some other time, I will explain
to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Logan then shewed me an old arithmetical book,
in quarto, wrote, I think, by one Stifelius, which contained
a square of 16, that he said he should imagine
must have been a work of great labour; but if I forget
not, it had only the common properties of making the
same sum, viz. 2056, in every row, horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal. Not willing to be out-done by Mr.
Stifelius, even in the size of my square, I went home,
and made, that evening, the following magical square
of 16, which, besides having all the properties of the
foregoing square of 8, <em>i. e.</em> it would make the 2056 in
all the same rows and diagonals, had this added, that a
four-square hole being cut in a piece of paper of such a
size as to take in and show through it just 16 of the
little squares, when laid on the greater square, the sum
of the 16 numbers so appearing through the hole,
wherever it was placed on the greater square, should
likewise make 2056. This I sent to our friend the next
morning, who, after some days, sent it back in a letter
with these words: "I return to thee thy astonishing
or most stupendous piece of the magical square, in
which&mdash;&mdash;" but the compliment is too extravagant,
and therefore, for his sake, as well as my own, I ought
not to repeat it. Nor is it necessary; for I make no
question but you will readily allow this square of 16
to be the most magically magical of any magic square
ever made by any magician. (<em>See the <a href="#PLATE_XI">Plate.</a></em>)</p>

<p>I did not, however, end with squares, but composed
also a magic circle, consisting of 8 concentric circles,
and 8 radial rows, filled with a series of numbers from
12 to 75 inclusive, so disposed as that the numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
each circle, or each radial row, being added to the
central number 12, they make exactly 360, the number
of degrees in a circle; and this circle had, moreover,
all the properties of the square of 8. If you desire
it, I will send it; but at present, I believe, you
have enough on this subject. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am glad the perusal of the magical squares afforded

<p>Its properties, besides those mentioned in my former,
are these.</p>

<p>Half the number in any radial row, added with half

<p>There are, moreover, included four other sets of circular
spaces, excentric with respect to the first, each of
these sets containing five spaces. The centres of the
circles that bound them, are at A, B, C, and D. Each
set, for the more easy distinguishing them from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>first, are drawn with a different coloured ink, red, blue,
green, and yellow.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>These sets of excentric circular spaces intersect those
of the concentric, and each other; and yet the numbers
contained in each of the twenty excentric spaces,
taken all around, make, with the central number, the
same sum as those in each of the 8 concentric, viz.
360. The halves, also of those drawn from the centres
A and C, taken above or below the double horizontal
line, and of those drawn from centres B and D, taken
to the right or left of the vertical line, do, with half the
central number, make just 180.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that there is not one of the numbers
but what belongs at least to two of the different
circular spaces; some to three, some to four, some to
five; and yet they are all so placed as never to break
the required number 360, in any of the 28 circular
spaces within the primitive circle.</p>

<p>These interwoven circles make so perplexed an appearance,
that it is not easy for the eye to trace every
circle of numbers one would examine, through all the
maze of circles intersected by it; but if you fix one
foot of the compasses in either of the centres, and extend
the other to any number in the circle you would
examine belonging to that centre, the moving foot will
point the others out, by passing round over all the numbers
of that circle successively. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Describing a new musical Instrument composed of Glasses.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>London, July 13, 1762.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Rev. Sir,</p>

<p>I once promised myself the pleasure of seeing you
at Turin, but as that is not now likely to happen, being
just about returning to my native country, America, I
sit down to take leave of you (among others of my European
friends that I cannot see) by writing.</p>

<p>I thank you for the honourable mention you have so
frequently made of me in your letters to Mr. Collinson
and others, for the generous defence you undertook and
executed with so much success, of my electrical opinions;
and for the valuable present you have made me of your
new work, from which I have received great information
and pleasure. I wish I could in return entertain
you with any thing new of mine on that subject; but I
have not lately pursued it. Nor do I know of any one
here that is at present much engaged in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, it may be agreeable to you, as you
live in a musical country, to have an account of the
new instrument lately added here to the great number
that charming science was before possessed of.&mdash;As it
is an instrument that seems peculiarly adapted to Italian
music, especially that of the soft and plaintive kind, I
will endeavour to give you such a description of it, and
of the manner of constructing it, that you or any of
your friends, may be enabled to imitate it, if you incline
so to do, without being at the expence and trouble
of the many experiments I have made in endeavouring
to bring it to its present perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>You have doubtless heard the sweet tone that is
drawn from a drinking glass, by passing a wet finger
round its brim. One Mr. Puckeridge, a gentleman
from Ireland, was the first who thought of playing
tunes, formed of these tones. He collected a number of
glasses of different sizes, fixed them near each other <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'on atable'">on
a table</ins>, and tuned them by putting into them water more
or less, as each note required. The tones were brought
out by passing his fingers round their brims.&mdash;He was
unfortunately burned here, with his instrument, in a
fire which consumed the house he lived in. Mr. E.
Delaval, a most ingenious member of our Royal Society,
made one in imitation of it, with a better choice
and form of glasses, which was the first I saw or heard.
Being charmed with the sweetness of its tones, and the
music he produced from it, I wished only to see the
glasses disposed in a more convenient form, and brought
together in a narrower compass, so as to admit of a
greater number of tones, and all within reach of hand
to a person sitting before the instrument, which I accomplished,
after various intermediate trials, and less
commodious forms, both of glasses and construction,
in the following manner.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i331.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The glasses are blown as near
as possible in the form of hemispheres,
having each an open neck
or socket in the middle. The
thickness of the glass near the
brim about a tenth of an inch, or
hardly quite so much, but thicker
as it comes nearer the neck, which
in the largest glasses is about an inch deep, and an
inch and half wide within, these dimensions lessening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
as the glasses themselves diminish in size, except that
the neck of the smallest ought not to be shorter than
half an inch.&mdash;The largest glass is nine inches diameter,
and the smallest three inches. Between these three are
twenty-three different sizes, differing from each other a
quarter of an inch in diameter.&mdash;To make a single instrument
there should be at least six glasses blown of
each size; and out of this number one may probably
pick thirty-seven glasses (which are sufficient for three
octaves with all the semitones) that will be each either
the note one wants or a little sharper than that note,
and all fitting so well into each other as to taper pretty
regularly from the largest to the smallest. It is true
there are not thirty-seven sizes, but it often happens
that two of the same size differ a note or half note in
tone, by reason of a difference in thickness, and these
may be placed one in the other without sensibly hurting
the regularity of the taper form.</p>

<p>The glasses being chosen, and every one marked
with a diamond the note you intend it for, they are to
be tuned by diminishing the thickness of those that are
too sharp. This is done by grinding them round from
the neck towards the brim, the breadth of one or two
inches, as may be required; often trying the glass by a
well tuned harpsichord, comparing the tone drawn from
the glass by your finger, with the note you want, as
sounded by that string of the harpsichord. When
you come nearer the matter, be careful to wipe the glass
clean and dry before each trial, because the tone is
something flatter when the glass is wet, than it will be
when dry;&mdash;and grinding a very little between each
trial, you will thereby tune to great exactness. The
more care is necessary in this, because if you go below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
your required tone, there is no sharpening it again but
by grinding somewhat off the brim, which will afterwards
require polishing, and thus increase the trouble.</p>

<p>The glasses being thus tuned, you are to be provided
with a case for them, and a spindle on which they are
to be fixed. My case is about three feet long, eleven
inches every way wide within at the biggest end, and
five inches at the smallest end; for it tapers all the way,
to adapt it better to the conical figure of the set of
glasses. This case opens in the middle of its height,
and the upper part turns up by hinges fixed behind.
The spindle, which is of hard iron, lies horizontally
from end to end of the box within, exactly in the middle,
and is made to turn on brass gudgeons at each end.
It is round, an inch diameter at the thickest end, and
tapering to a quarter of an inch at the smallest.&mdash;A
square shank comes from its thickest end through the
box, on which shank a wheel is fixed by a screw. This
wheel serves as a fly to make the motion equable, when
the spindle, with the glasses, is turned by the foot like a
spinning-wheel. My wheel is of mahogany, eighteen
inches diameter, and pretty thick, so as to conceal near
its circumference about 25lb of lead.&mdash;An ivory pin is
fixed in the face of this wheel, and about four inches
from the axis. Over the neck of this pin is put the
loop of the string that comes up from the moveable
step to give it motion. The case stands on a neat
frame with four legs.</p>

<p>To fix the glasses on the spindle, a cork is first to be
fitted in each neck pretty tight, and projecting a little
without the neck, that the neck of one may not touch
the inside of another when put together, for that would
make a jarring.&mdash;These corks are to be perforated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
holes of different diameters, so as to suit that part of
the spindle on which they are to be fixed. When a
glass is put on, by holding it stiffly between both hands,
while another turns the spindle, it may be gradually
brought to its place. But care must be taken that the
hole be not too small, lest in forcing it up the neck
should split; nor too large, lest the glass not being
firmly fixed should turn or move on the spindle, so as
to touch and jar against its neighbouring glass. The
glasses thus are placed one in another, the largest on
the biggest end of the spindle which is to the left hand;
the neck of this glass is towards the wheel, and the next
goes into it in the same position, only about an inch of
its brim appearing beyond the brim of the first; thus
proceeding, every glass when fixed shews about an inch
of its brim (or three quarters of an inch, or half an
inch, as they grow smaller) beyond the brim of the glass
that contains it; and it is from these exposed parts of
each glass that the tone is drawn, by laying a finger
upon one of them as the spindle and glasses turn
round.</p>

<p>My largest glass is G, a little below the reach of a
common voice, and my highest G, including three
compleat octaves.&mdash;To distinguish the glasses the more
readily to the eye, I have painted the apparent parts of
the glasses within side, every semitone white, and the
other notes of the octave with the seven prismatic colours,
<em>viz.</em> C, red; D, orange; E, yellow; F, green; G,
blue; A, indigo; B, purple; and C, red again;&mdash;so
that glasses of the same colour (the white excepted) are
always octaves to each other.</p>

<p>This instrument is played upon, by sitting before the
middle of the set of glasses as before the keys of a harp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>sichord,
turning them with the foot, and wetting them
now and then with a spunge and clean water. The fingers
should be first a little soaked in water, and quite
free from all greasiness; a little fine chalk upon them
is sometimes useful, to make them catch the glass and
bring out the tone more readily. Both hands are used,
by which means different parts are played together.&mdash;Observe,
that the tones are best drawn out when the
glasses turn <em>from</em> the ends of the fingers, not when they
turn <em>to</em> them.</p>

<p>The advantages of this instrument are, that its tones
are incomparably sweet beyond those of any other; that
they may be swelled and softened at pleasure by
stronger or weaker pressures of the finger, and continued
to any length; and that the instrument, being
once well tuned, never again wants tuning.</p>

<p>In honour of your musical language, I have borrowed
from it the name of this instrument, calling it the
Armonica.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Respecting the best Mediums for conveying Sound.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>July 20, 1762.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I have perused your paper on sound, and would
freely mention to you, as you desire it, every thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
appeared to me to need correction:&mdash;But nothing of
that kind occurs to me, unless it be, where you speak
of the air as "the <em>best</em> medium for conveying sound."
Perhaps this is speaking rather too positively, if there
be, as I think there are, some other mediums that will
convey it farther and more readily.&mdash;It is a well-known
experiment, that the scratching of a pin at one end of
a long piece of timber, may be heard by an ear applied
near the other end, though it could not be heard at the
same distance through the air.&mdash;And two stones being
struck smartly together under water, the stroke may be
heard at a greater distance by an ear also placed under
water, than it can be heard through the air. I think I
have heard it near a mile; how much farther it may be
heard I know not; but suppose a great deal farther, because
the sound did not seem faint, as if at a distance,
like distant sounds through air, but smart and strong,
and as if present just at the ear.&mdash;I wish you would repeat
these experiments now you are upon the subject,
and add your own observations.&mdash;And if you were to
repeat, with your naturally exact attention and observation,
the common experiment of the bell in the exhausted
receiver, possibly something new may occur to
you, in considering,</p>

<p>1. Whether the experiment is not ambiguous; <em>i. e.</em>
whether the gradual exhausting of the air, as it creates
an increasing difference of pressure on the outside, may
not occasion in the glass a difficulty of vibrating, that
renders it less fit to communicate to the air without,
the vibrations that strike it from within; and the diminution
of the sound arise from this cause, rather than
from the diminution of the air?</p>

<p>2. Whether, as the particles of air themselves are at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
a distance from each other, there must not be some medium
between them, proper for conveying sound, since
otherwise it would stop at the first particle?</p>

<p>3. Whether the great difference we experience in
hearing sounds at a distance, when the wind blows towards
us from the sonorous body, or towards that from
us, can be well accounted for by adding to or <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'substracting'">subtracting</ins>
from the swiftness of sound, the degree of swiftness
that is in the wind at the time? The latter is so
small in proportion, that it seems as if it could scarce
produce any sensible effect, and yet the difference is
very great. Does not this give some hint, as if there
might be a subtle fluid, the conductor of sound, which
moves at different times in different directions over the
surface of the earth, and whose motion may perhaps be
much swifter than that of the air in our strongest winds;
and that in passing through air, it may communicate
that motion to the air which we call wind, though a motion
in no degree so swift as its own?</p>

<p>4. It is somewhere related, that a pistol fired on the
top of an exceeding high mountain, made a noise like
thunder in the valleys below. Perhaps this fact is
not exactly related: but if it is, would not one imagine
from it, that the rarer the air, the greater sound might
be produced in it from the same cause?</p>

<p>5. Those balls of fire which are sometimes seen passing
over a country, computed by philosophers to be
often thirty miles high at least, sometimes burst at that
height; the air must be exceeding rare there, and yet
the explosion produces a sound that is heard at that
distance, and for seventy miles round on the surface of
the earth, so violent too as to shake buildings, and give
an apprehension of an earthquake. Does not this look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
as if a rare atmosphere, almost a vacuum, was no bad
conductor of sound?</p>

<p>I have not made up my own mind on these points,
and only mention them for your consideration, knowing
that every subject is the better for your handling it.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Harmony and Melody of the old Scotch Tunes.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>June 2, 1765.</em></p>

<p>**** In my passage to America I read your excellent
work, the <cite>Elements of Criticism</cite>, in which I found
great entertainment. I only wished you had examined
more fully the subject of music, and demonstrated that
the pleasure artists feel in hearing much of that composed
in the modern taste, is not the natural pleasure
arising from melody or harmony of sounds, but of the
same kind with the pleasure we feel on seeing the surprising
feats of tumblers and rope-dancers, who execute
difficult things. For my part I take this to be really
the case, and suppose it the reason why those who are
unpractised in music, and therefore unacquainted with
those difficulties, have little or no pleasure in hearing
this music. Many pieces of it are mere compositions
of tricks. I have sometimes, at a concert, attended by
a common audience, placed myself so as to see all their
faces, and observed no signs of pleasure in them during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the performance of a great part that was admired by
the performers themselves; while a plain old Scotch
tune, which they disdained, and could scarcely be prevailed
on to play, gave manifest and general delight.
Give me leave, on this occasion, to extend a little the
sense of your position, that "melody and harmony
are separately agreeable, and in union delightful," and
to give it as my opinion, that the reason why the Scotch
tunes have lived so long, and will probably live for ever
(if they escape being stifled in modern affected ornament)
is merely this, that they are really compositions
of melody and harmony united, or rather that their melody
is harmony. I mean the simple tunes sung by a
single voice. As this will appear paradoxical, I must
explain my meaning. In common acceptation, indeed,
only an agreeable <em>succession</em> of sounds is called <em>melody</em>,
and only the <em>co-existence</em> of agreeable sounds, <em>harmony</em>.
But since the memory is capable of retaining for some
moments a perfect idea of the pitch of a past sound, so
as to compare with it the pitch of a succeeding sound,
and judge truly of their agreement or disagreement,
there may and does arise from thence a sense of harmony
between the present and past sounds, equally
pleasing with that <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'betwen two'">between two</ins> present sounds. Now
the construction of the old Scotch tunes is this, that
almost every succeeding emphatical note is a third, a
fifth, an octave, or in short some note that is in concord
with the preceding note. Thirds are chiefly used,
which are very pleasing concords. I use the word <em>emphatical</em>
to distinguish those notes which have a stress
laid on them in singing the tune, from the lighter connecting
notes, that serve merely, like grammar articles
in common speech, to tack the whole together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>That we have a most perfect idea of a sound just
past, I might appeal to all acquainted with music, who
know how easy it is to repeat a sound in the same pitch
with one just heard. In tuning an instrument, a good
ear can as easily determine that two strings are in unison
by sounding them separately, as by sounding them
together; their disagreement is also as easily, I believe
I may say more easily and better distinguished, when
sounded separately; for when sounded together, though
you know by the beating that one is higher than the
other, you cannot tell which it is. I have ascribed to
memory the ability of comparing the pitch of a present
tone with that of one past. But if there should be, as
possibly there may be, something in the ear, similar to
what we find in the eye, that ability would not be entirely
owing to memory. Possibly the vibrations given
to the auditory nerves by a particular sound may actually
continue some time after the cause of those vibrations
is past, and the agreement or disagreement of a
subsequent sound become by comparison with them
more discernible. For the impression made on the visual
nerves by a luminous object will continue for twenty
or thirty seconds. Sitting in a room, look earnestly at
the middle of a window a little while when the day is
bright, and then shut your eyes; the figure of the window
will still remain in the eye, and so distinct that you
may count the panes. A remarkable circumstance attending
this experiment, is, that the impression of forms
is better retained than that of colours; for after the
eyes are shut, when you first discern the image of the
window, the panes appear dark, and the cross bars of
the sashes, with the window frames and walls, appear
white or bright; but if you still add to the darkness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the eyes by covering them with your hand, the reverse
instantly takes place, the panes appear luminous and the
cross bars dark. And by removing the hand they are
again reversed. This I know not how to account for.&mdash;Nor
for the following; that after looking long through
green spectacles, the white paper of a book will on first
taking them off appear to have a blush of red; and after
long looking through red glasses, a greenish cast; this
seems to intimate a relation between green and red not
yet explained. Farther, when we consider by whom
these ancient tunes were composed, and how they were
first performed, we shall see that such harmonical successions
of sounds was natural and even necessary in their
construction. They were composed by the minstrels of
those days to be played on the harp accompanied by the
voice. The harp was strung with wire, which gives a
sound of long continuance, and had no contrivance like
that in the modern harpsichord, by which the sound of
the preceding could be stopt, the moment a succeeding
note began. To avoid actual discord, it was therefore
necessary that the succeeding emphatic note should be
a chord with the preceding, as their sounds must exist
at the same time. Hence arose that beauty in those
tunes that has so long pleased, and will please for ever,
though men scarce know why. That they were originally
composed for the harp, and of the most simple
kind, I mean a harp without any half notes but those
in the natural scale, and with no more than two octaves
of strings, from C to C, I conjecture from another circumstance,
which is, that not one of those tunes, really
ancient, has a single artificial half note in it, and that
in tunes where it was most convenient for the voice to
use the middle notes of the harp, and place the key in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
F, there the B, which if used should be a B flat, is always
omitted, by passing over it with a third. The
connoisseurs in modern music will say, I have no taste,
but I cannot help adding, that I believe our ancestors,
in hearing a good song, distinctly articulated, sung to
one of those tunes, and accompanied by the harp, felt
more real pleasure than is communicated by the generality
of modern operas, exclusive of that arising from
the scenery and dancing. Most tunes of late composition,
not having this natural harmony united with their
melody, have recourse to the artificial harmony of a
bass, and other accompanying parts.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This support,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
in my opinion, the old tunes do not need, and are rather
confused than aided by it. Whoever has heard
James Oswald play them on his violoncello, will be less
inclined to dispute this with me. I have more than
once seen tears of pleasure in the eyes of his auditors;
and yet, I think, even <em>his</em> playing those tunes would
please more, if he gave them less modern ornament.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the Defects of Modern Music.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2">[No date.]</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Brother,</p>

<p>**** I like your ballad, and think it well adapted
for your purpose of discountenancing expensive foppery,
and encouraging industry and frugality. If you
can get it generally sung in your country, it may probably
have a good deal of the effect you hope and expect
from it. But as you aimed at making it general, I
wonder you chose so uncommon a measure in poetry,
that none of the tunes in common use will suit it. Had
you fitted it to an old one, well known, it must have
spread much faster than I doubt it will do from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
best new tune we can get composed for it. I think
too, that if you had given it to some country girl in the
heart of the Massachusets, who has never heard any
other than psalm tunes, or <cite>Chevy Chace</cite>, the <cite>Children in
the Wood</cite>, the <cite>Spanish Lady</cite>, and such old simple ditties,
but has naturally a good ear, she might more probably
have made a pleasing popular tune for you, than
any of our masters here, and more proper for your purpose,
which would best be answered, if every word
could as it is sung be understood by all that hear it, and
if the emphasis you intend for particular words could
be given by the singer as well as by the reader; much
of the force and impression of the song depending on
those circumstances. I will however get it as well
done for you as I can.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that I mean to depreciate the skill
of our composers of music here; they are admirable at
pleasing <em>practised</em> ears, and know how to delight <em>one
another</em>; but, in composing for songs, the reigning
taste seems to be quite out of nature, or rather the reverse
of nature, and yet like a torrent, hurries them all
away with it; one or two perhaps only excepted.</p>

<p>You, in the spirit of some ancient legislators, would
influence the manners of your country by the united
powers of poetry and music. By what I can learn of
<em>their</em> songs, the music was simple, conformed itself to
the usual pronunciation of words, as to measure, cadence
or emphasis, &amp;c. never disguised and confounded
the language by making a long syllable short, or a
short one long when sung; their singing was only a
more pleasing, because a melodious manner of speaking;
it was capable of all the graces of prose oratory,
while it added the pleasure of harmony. A modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
song, on the contrary, neglects all the proprieties and
beauties of common speech, and in their place introduces
its <em>defects</em> and <em>absurdities</em> as so many graces. I
am afraid you will hardly take my word for this, and
therefore I must endeavour to support it by proof.
Here is the first song I lay my hand on. It happens
to be a composition of one of our greatest masters, the
ever-famous Handel. It is not one of his juvenile performances,
before his taste could be improved and
formed: it appeared when his reputation was at the
highest, is greatly admired by all his admirers, and is
really excellent in its kind. It is called, "The additional
favourite song in Judas Maccabeus." Now I
reckon among the defects and improprieties of common
speech, the following, viz.</p>

<p>1. <em>Wrong placing the accent or emphasis</em>, by laying it
on words of no importance, or on wrong syllables.</p>

<p>2. <em>Drawling</em>; or extending the sound of words or
syllables beyond their natural length.</p>

<p>3. <em>Stuttering</em>; or making many syllables of one.</p>

<p>4. <em>Unintelligibleness</em>; the result of the three foregoing
united.</p>

<p>5. <em>Tautology</em>; and</p>

<p>6. <em>Screaming</em>, without cause.</p>

<p>For the <em>wrong placing of the accent, or emphasis</em>, see
it on the word <em>their</em> instead of being on the word <em>vain</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i345m.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>And on the word <em>from</em>, and the wrong syllable <em>like</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i346m1.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the <em>drawling</em>, see the last syllable of the word
<em>wounded</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i346m2.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>And in the syllable <em>wis</em>, and the word <em>from</em>, and syllable
<em>bove</em></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i346m3.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the <em>stuttering</em>, see the words <em>ne'er relieve</em>, in</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i346m4.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here are four syllables made of one, and eight of three;
but this is moderate. I have seen in another song that
I cannot now find, seventeen syllables made of three,
and sixteen of one: the latter I remember was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
word <em>charms</em>; viz. <em>cha, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
a, a, arms</em>. Stammering with a witness!</p>

<p>For the <em>unintelligibleness</em>; give this whole song to
any taught singer, and let her sing it to any company
that have never heard it; you shall find they will not
understand three words in ten. It is therefore, that at
the oratorios and operas one sees with books in their
hands all those who desire to understand what they
hear sung by even our best performers.</p>

<p>For the <em>tautology</em>; you have, <em>with their vain mysterious
art</em>, twice repeated; <em>magic charms can ne'er relieve
you</em>, three times. <em>Nor can heal the wounded heart</em>, three
times. <em>Godlike wisdom from above</em>, twice; and, <em>this
alone can deceive you</em>, two or three times. But this is
reasonable when compared with <em>the Monster Polypheme,
the Monster Polypheme</em>, a hundred times over and over,
in his admired <cite>Acis and Galatea</cite>.</p>

<p>As to the <em>screaming</em>; perhaps I cannot find a fair instance
in this song; but whoever has frequented our
operas will remember many. And yet here methinks
the words <em>no</em> and <em>e'er</em>, when sung to these notes, have
a little of the air of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'srceaming'"><em>screaming</em></ins>, and would actually be
screamed by some singers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i347m.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I send you inclosed the song with its music at length.
Read the words without the repetitions. Observe how
few they are, and what a shower of notes attend them:
you will then perhaps be inclined to think with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
that though the words might be the principal part of an
ancient song, they are of small importance in a modern
one; they are in short only <em>a pretence for singing</em>.</p>

<p class="right padr6">I am, as ever,</p>

<p class="right padr4">Your affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="right padr2">B. FRANKLIN.</p>

<p>P. S. I might have mentioned <em>inarticulation</em> among
the defects in common speech that are assumed as
beauties in modern singing. But as that seems more
the fault of the singer than of the composer, I omitted
it in what related merely to the composition. The fine
singer in the present mode, stifles all the hard consonants,
and polishes away all the rougher parts of words
that serve to distinguish them one from another; so
that you hear nothing but an admirable pipe, and understand
no more of the song, than you would from its
tune played on any other instrument. If ever it was the
ambition of musicians to make instruments that should
imitate the human voice, that ambition seems now reversed,
the voice aiming to be like an instrument.
Thus wigs were first made to imitate a good natural
head of hair;&mdash;but when they became fashionable,
though in unnatural forms, we have seen natural hair
dressed to look like wigs.</p>

Sheets of Paper in the Chinese Manner, with one smooth
surface.</em></a><a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></h3>

<p>In Europe to have a large surface of paper connected
together and smooth on one side, the following operations
are performed.</p>

<p>1. A number of small sheets are to be made separately.</p>

<p>2. These are to be couched, one by one, between
blankets.</p>

<p>3. When a heap is formed it must be put under a
strong press, to force out the water.</p>

<p>4. Then the blankets are to be taken away, one by
one, and the sheets hung up to dry.</p>

<p>5. When dry they are to be again pressed, or if to
be sized, they must be dipped into size made of warm
water, in which glue and alum are dissolved.</p>

<p>6. They must then be pressed again to force out the
superfluous size.</p>

<p>7. They must then be hung up a second time to dry,
which, if the air happens to be damp, requires some
days.</p>

<p>8. They must then be taken down, laid together, and
again pressed.</p>

<p>9. They must be pasted together at their edges.</p>

<p>10. The whole must be glazed by labour, with a
flint.</p>

<p>In China, if they would make sheets, suppose of four
and a half ells long and one and a half ells wide, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
have two large vats, each five ells long and two ells
wide, made of brick, lined with a plaster that holds water.
In these the stuff is mixed ready to work.</p>

<p>Between these vats is built a kiln or stove, with two
inclining sides; each side something larger than the
sheet of paper; they are covered with a fine stucco
that takes a polish, and are so contrived as to be well
heated by a small fire circulating in the walls.</p>

<p>The mould is made with thin but deep sides, that it
may be both light and stiff: it is suspended at each end
with cords that pass over pullies fastened to the cieling,
their ends connected with a counterpoise nearly equal
the weight of the mould.</p>

<p>Two men, one at each end of the mould, lifting it
out of the water by the help of the counterpoise, turn
it and apply it with the stuff to the smooth surface of
the stove, against which they press it, to force out great
part of the water through the wires. The heat of the
wall soon evaporates the rest, and a boy takes off the
dried sheet by rolling it up. The side next the stove
receives the even polish of the stucco, and is thereby
better fitted to receive the impression of fine prints. If
a degree of sizing is required, a decoction of rice is
mixed with the stuff in the vat.</p>

<p>Thus the great sheet is obtained, smooth and sized,
and a number of the European operations saved.</p>

<p>As the stove has two polished sides, and there are
two vats, the same operation is at the same time performed
by two other men at the other vat; and one
fire serves.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On Modern Innovations in the English Language and in Printing.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Philadelphia, Dec</em>.26, 1789.</p>

<p class="smcap pad2">Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I received, some time since, your <cite>Dissertations
on the English Language</cite>. It is an excellent work, and
will be greatly useful in turning the thoughts of our
countrymen to correct writing. Please to accept my
thanks for it, as well as for the great honour you have
done me in its dedication. I ought to have made this
acknowledgment sooner, but much indisposition prevented
me.</p>

<p>I cannot but applaud your zeal for preserving the
purity of our language both in its expression and pronunciation,
and in correcting the popular errors several
of our states are continually falling into with respect to
both. Give me leave to mention some of them, though
possibly they may already have occurred to you. I
wish, however, that in some future publication of yours,
you would set a discountenancing mark upon them.
The first I remember, is the word <em>improved</em>. When I
left New England in the year 1723, this word had never
been used among us, as far as I know, but in the
sense of <em>ameliorated</em>, or <em>made better</em>, except once in a
very old book of Dr. Mather's, entitled <cite>Remarkable
Providences</cite>. As that man wrote a very obscure hand,
I remember that when I read that word in his book
used instead of the word <em>employed</em>, I conjectured that
it was an error of the printer, who had mistaken a short
<em>l</em> in the writing for an <em>r</em>, and a <em>y</em> with too short a tail
for a <em>v</em>, whereby <em>employed</em> was converted into <em>improved</em>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
but when I returned to Boston in 1733, I found this
change had obtained favour, and was then become common;
for I met with it often in perusing the newspapers,
where it frequently made an appearance rather
ridiculous. Such, for instance, as the advertisement of
a country house to be sold, which had been many years
<em>improved</em> as a tavern; and in the character of a deceased
country gentleman, that he had been, for more than
thirty years, <em>improved</em> as a justice of the peace. This
use of the word <em>improve</em> is peculiar to New England,
and not to be met with among any other speakers of
English, either on this or the other side of the water.</p>

<p>During my late absence in France, I find that several
other new words have been introduced into our parliamentary
language. For example, I find a verb from
the substantive <em>notice</em>. <em>I should not have</em> noticed <em>this,
were it not that the gentleman</em>, &amp;c. Also another verb,
from the substantive <em>advocate</em>; <em>The gentleman who</em> advocates,
<em>or who has</em> advocated <em>that motion</em>,&amp;c. Another
from the substantive <em>progress</em>, the most awkward
and abominable of the three: <em>the committee having</em> progressed,
<em>resolved to adjourn</em>. The word <em>opposed</em>, though
not a new word, I find used in a new manner, as, <em>the
gentlemen who are</em> opposed <em>to this measure, to which I
have also myself always been</em> opposed. If you should
happen to be of my opinion with respect to these innovations,
you will use your authority in reprobating
them.</p>

<p>The Latin language, long the vehicle used in distributing
knowledge among the different nations of Europe,
is daily more and more neglected; and one of the
modern tongues, viz. French, seems, in point of universality,
to have supplied its place. It is spoken in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the courts of Europe; and most of the literati, those even
who do not speak it, have acquired enough knowledge
of it, to enable them easily to read the books, that are
written in it. This gives a considerable advantage to that
nation. It enables its authors to inculcate and spread
through other nations, such sentiments and opinions,
on important points, as are most conducive to its interests,
or which may contribute to its reputation, by
promoting the common interests of mankind. It is,
perhaps, owing to its being written in French, that
Voltaire's Treatise on Toleration has had so sudden and
so great an effect on the bigotry of Europe, as almost
entirely to disarm it. The general use of the French
language has likewise a very advantageous effect on
the profits of the bookselling branch of commerce, it
being well known, that the more copies can be sold,
that are struck off from one composition of types, the
profits increase in a much greater proportion, than they
do in making a greater number of pieces in any other
kind of manufacture. And at present there is no capital
town in Europe without a French bookseller's shop
corresponding with Paris. Our English bids fair to
obtain the second place. The great body of excellent
printed sermons in our language, and the freedom of
our writings on political subjects, have induced a great
dumber of divines of different sects and nations, as well
as gentlemen concerned in public affairs, to study it, so
far at least as to read it. And if we were to endeavour
the facilitating its progress, the study of our tongue
might become much more general. Those, who have
employed some part of their time in learning a new
language, must have frequently observed, that while
their acquaintance with it was imperfect, difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
small in themselves, operated as great ones in obstructing
their progress. A book, for example, ill printed,
or a pronunciation in speaking, not well articulated,
would render a sentence unintelligible, which, from a
clear print, or a distinct speaker, would have been immediately
comprehended. If, therefore, we would have
the benefit of seeing our language more generally
known among mankind, we should endeavour to remove
all the difficulties, however small, that discourage
the learning of it. But I am sorry to observe, that, of
late years, those difficulties, instead of being diminished,
have been augmented.</p>

<p>In examining the English books, that were printed
between the restoration and the accession of George
the Second, we may observe, that all the substantives
were begun with a capital, in which we imitated our
mother tongue, the German. This was more particularly
useful to those, who were not well acquainted with
the English, there being such a prodigious number of
our words, that are both verbs and substantives, and
spelt in the same manner, though often accented differently
in pronunciation. This method has, by the
fancy of printers, of late years been entirely laid aside;
from an idea, that suppressing the capitals shows the
character to greater advantage; those letters prominent
above the line, disturbing its even, regular appearance.
The effect of this change is so considerable, that
a learned man of France, who used to read our books,
though not perfectly acquainted with our language, in
conversation with me on the subject of our authors, attributed
the greater obscurity he found in our modern
books, compared with those of the period above mentioned,
to a change of style for the worse in our writers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of which mistake I convinced him, by marking for him
each substantive with a capital, in a paragraph, which
he then easily understood, though before he could not
comprehend it. This shows the inconvenience of that
pretended improvement.</p>

<p>From the same fondness for an uniform and even appearance
of characters in the line, the printers have of
late banished also the Italic types, in which words, of
importance to be attended to in the sense of the sentence,
and words, on which an emphasis should be put
in reading, used to be printed. And lately, another
fancy has induced other printers to use the round <em>s</em>
instead of the long one, which formerly served well to
distinguish a word readily by its varied appearance.
Certainly the omitting this prominent letter makes a
line appear more even, but renders it less immediately
legible; as the paring of all men's noses might smooth
and level their faces, but would render their physiognomies
less distinguishable. Add to all these improvements
backwards, another modern fancy, that <em>grey</em>
printing is more beautiful than black. Hence the
English new books are printed in so dim a character, as
to be read with difficulty by old eyes; unless in a very
strong light and with good glasses. Whoever compares
a volume of the Gentleman's Magazine, printed
between the years 1731 and 1740, with one of those
printed in the last ten years, will be convinced of the
much greater degree of perspicuity given by black than
by the grey. Lord Chesterfield pleasantly remarked
this difference to Faulkener, the printer of the Dublin
Journal, who was vainly making encomiums on his own
paper, as the most complete of any in the world. "But
Mr. Faulkener," says my lord, "don't you think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
might be still farther improved, by using paper and ink
not quite so near of a colour?"&mdash;For all these reasons, I
cannot but wish, that our American printers would, in
their editions, avoid these fancied improvements, and
thereby render their works more agreeable to foreigners
in Europe, to the great advantage of our bookselling
commerce.</p>

<p>Farther, to be more sensible of the advantage of clear
and distinct printing, let us consider the assistance it
affords in reading well aloud to an auditory. In so
doing, the eye generally slides forward three or four
words before the voice. If the sight clearly distinguishes
what the coming words are, it gives time to
order the modulation of the voice to express them properly.
But if they are obscurely printed or disguised,
by omitting the capitals and long <em>&#643;</em>'s, or otherwise, the
reader is apt to modulate wrong; and finding he has
done so, he is obliged to go back and begin the sentence
again; which lessens the pleasure of the hearers.
This leads me to mention an old error in our mode of
printing. We are sensible, that when a question is met
with in the reading, there is a proper variation to be
used in the management of the voice. We have therefore
a point, called an interrogation, affixed to the
question, in order to distinguish it. But this is absurdly
placed at its end, so that the reader does not
discover it till he finds, that he has wrongly modulated
his voice, and is therefore obliged to begin again the
sentence. To prevent this, the Spanish printers, more
sensibly, place an interrogation at the beginning as well
as at the end of the question. We have another error
of the same kind in printing plays, where something
often occurs, that is marked as spoken <em>aside</em>. But the
word <em>aside</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
is placed at the end of the speech, when it
ought to precede it, as a direction to the reader, that he
may govern his voice accordingly. The practice of our
ladies in meeting five or six together, to form little busy
parties, where each is employed in some useful work,
while one reads to them, is so commendable in itself,
that it deserves the attention of authors and printers to
make it as pleasing as possible, both to the reader and
hearers.</p>

<p>In this alphabet <em>c</em> is <em>omitted</em> as unnecessary; <em>k</em> supplying
its hard sound, and <em>s</em> the soft; <em>k</em> also supplies
well the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'place of z'">place of <em>q</em></ins>, and with an <em>s</em> added the place of <em>x</em>:
<em>q</em> and <em>x</em> are therefore omitted. The vowel <em>u</em> being
sounded as <em>oo</em> makes the <em>w</em> unnecessary. The <em>y</em>, where
used simply, is supplied by <em>i</em>, and where as a dipthong,
by two vowels: that letter is therefore omitted as useless.
The jod <em>j</em> is also omitted, its sound being supplied
by the new letter <span class="large"><em><img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" /></em></span>, <em>ish</em>, which serves other purposes,
assisting in the formation of other sounds;&mdash;thus the <span class="large"><em><img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" /></em></span>
with a <em>d</em> before it gives the sound of the jod <em>j</em> and soft
<em>g</em>, as in "James, January, giant, gentle," "<span class="large"><em>d<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" />eems</em>,
<em>d<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" />hanueri</em>, <em>d<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" /><img class="bfl2" src="images/i357xx2.jpg" alt="" />iant</em>, <em>d<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" />entel</em></span>;" with a <em>t</em> before
it, it gives the sound of <em>ch</em>, as in "cherry, chip,"
"<span class="large"><em>t<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" />eri</em>, <em>t<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" />ip</em></span>;" and with a <em>z</em> before it, the French
sound of the jod <em>j</em>, as in "jamais," "<span class="large"><em>z<img class="bfl" src="images/i357xx3.jpg" alt="" />ame</em>.</span>"</p>

<p>Thus the <em>g</em> has no longer <em>two different</em> sounds, which
occasioned confusion, but is, as every letter ought to
be, confined to one. The same is to be observed in <em>all</em>
the letters, vowels, and consonants, that wherever they
are met with, or in whatever company, their sound is
always the same. It is also intended, that there be <em>no
superfluous</em> letters used in spelling; i. e. no letter that is
not sounded; and this alphabet, by six new letters, provides,
that, there be no distinct sounds in the language,
<em>without letters</em> to express them. As to the difference
between <em>short and long vowels</em>, it is naturally expressed
by a single vowel where short, a double one where long;
as for "mend," write "mend," but for "remain'd,"
write "remeen'd;" for "did" write "did," but for
"deed" write "diid," &amp;c.</p>

<p>What in our common alphabet is supposed the third
vowel, <em>i</em>, as we sound it, is as a <em>dipthong</em>, consisting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
two of our vowels joined; [viz.] <span class="large"><em><img class="bfl2" src="images/i357xx2.jpg" alt="" /></em></span> as sounded in "unto,"
and <em>i</em> in its true sound. Any one will be sensible of this
who sounds those two vowels <span class="large"><em><img class="bfl2" src="images/i357xx2.jpg" alt="" /></em></span> <em>i</em> quick after each other;
the sounds begins <span class="large"><em><img class="bfl2" src="images/i357xx2.jpg" alt="" /></em></span> and ends <em>ii</em>. The true sound of the
<em>i</em> is that we now give to <em>e</em> in the words "deed, keep&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>."</p>

Trustees of the Philadelphia Academy</em></a><a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</h3>

<p>It is expected that every scholar, to be admitted into
this school, be at least able to pronounce and divide
the syllables in reading, and to write a legible hand.
None to be received, that are under [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] years of age.</p>


<p class="center"><em>First, or lowest Class.</em></p>

<p>Let the first class learn the English Grammar rules,
and at the same time let particular care be taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
improve them in orthography. Perhaps the latter is
best done by pairing the scholars; two of those nearest
equal in their spelling to be put together. Let these
strive for victory; each propounding ten words every
day to the other to be spelled. He that spells truly
most of the other's words is victor for that day; he
that is victor most days in a month, to obtain a prize,
a pretty neat book of some kind, useful in their future
studies. This method fixes the attention of children
extremely to the orthography of words, and makes
them good spellers very early. It is a shame for a man
to be so ignorant of this little art, in his own language,
as to be perpetually confounding words of like sound
and different significations; the consciousness of which
defect makes some men, otherwise of good learning
and understanding, averse to writing even a common
letter.</p>

<p>Let the pieces read by the scholars in this class be
short; such as Croxal's fables, and little stories. In
giving the lesson, let it be read to them; let the meaning
of the difficult words in it be explained to them;
and let them con over by themselves before they are
called to read to the master or usher, who is to take
particular care, that they do not read too fast, and that
they duly observe the stops and pauses. A vocabulary
of the most usual difficult words might be formed for
their use, with explanations; and they might daily get
a few of those words and explanations by heart, which
would a little exercise their memories; or at least they
might write a number of them in a small book for the
purpose, which would help to fix the meaning of those
words in their minds, and at the same time furnish every
one with a little dictionary for his future use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><em>The Second Class</em></p>

<p>To be taught, reading with attention, and with proper
modulations of the voice, according to the sentiment
and the subject.</p>

<p>Some short pieces, not exceeding the length of a
Spectator, to be given this class for lessons (and some
of the easier Spectators would be very suitable for the
purpose). These lessons might be given every night as
tasks; the scholars to study them against the morning.
Let it then be required of them to give an account, first
of the parts of speech, and construction of one or two
sentences. This will oblige them to recur frequently to
their grammar, and fix its principal rules in their memory.
Next, of the intention of the writer, or the
scope of the piece, the meaning of each sentence, and
of every uncommon word. This would early acquaint
them with the meaning and force of words, and
give them that most necessary habit, of reading with
attention.</p>

<p>The master then to read the piece with the proper
modulations of voice, due emphasis, and suitable action,
where action is required; and put the youth on
imitating his manner.</p>

<p>Where the author has used an expression not the
best, let it be pointed out; and let his beauties be particularly
remarked to the youth.</p>

<p>Let the lessons for reading be varied, that the youth
may be made acquainted with good styles of all kinds,
in prose and verse, and the proper manner of reading
each kind&mdash;sometimes a well-told story, a piece of a
sermon, a general's speech to his soldiers, a speech in a
tragedy, some part of a comedy, an ode, a satire, a letter,
blank verse, Hudibrastic, heroic, &amp;c. But let such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
lessons be chosen for reading, as contain some useful
instruction, whereby the understanding or morals of
the youth may at the same time be improved.</p>

<p>It is required that they should first study and understand
the lessons, before they are put upon reading
them properly; to which end each boy should have an
English dictionary, to help him over difficulties. When
our boys read English to us, we are apt to imagine they
understand what they read, because we do, and because
it is their mother tongue. But they often read, as parrots
speak, knowing little or nothing of the meaning.
And it is impossible a reader should give the due modulation
to his voice, and pronounce properly, unless
his understanding goes before his tongue, and makes
him master of the sentiment. Accustoming boys to
read aloud what they do not first understand, is the
cause of those even set tones, so common among readers,
which, when they have once got a habit of using,
they find so difficult to correct; by which means,
among fifty readers we scarcely find a good one. For
want of good reading, pieces published with a view to
influence the minds of men, for their own or the public
benefit, lose half their force. Were there but one good
reader in a neighbourhood, a public orator might be
heard throughout a nation with the same advantages,
and have the same effect upon his audience, as if they
stood within the reach of his voice.</p>

<p class="center"><em>The Third Class</em></p>

<p>To be taught speaking properly and gracefully;
which is near a-kin to good reading, and naturally follows
it in the studies of youth. Let the scholars of
this class begin with learning the elements of rhetoric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
from some short system, so as to be able to give an account
of the most useful tropes and figures. Let all
their bad habits of speaking, all offences against good
grammar, all corrupt or foreign accents, and all improper
phrases, be pointed out to them. Short speeches
from the Romans, or other history, or from the parliamentary
debates, might be got by heart, and delivered
with the proper action, &amp;c. Speeches and scenes in
our best tragedies and comedies (avoiding every thing,
that could injure the morals of youth) might likewise
be got by rote, and the boys exercised in delivering or
acting them: great care being taken to form their manner
after the truest models.</p>

<p>For their farther improvement, and a little to vary
their studies, let them now begin to read history, after
having got by heart a short table of the principal
epochs in chronology. They may begin with Rollin's
ancient and Roman histories, and proceed at proper
hours, as they go through the subsequent classes,
with the best histories of our own nation and colonies.
Let emulation be excited among the boys, by giving,
weekly, little prizes, or other small encouragements to
those, who are able to give the best account of what
they have read, as to time, places, names of persons,
&amp;c. This will make them read with attention, and imprint
the history well in their memories. In remarking
on the history, the master will have fine opportunities
of instilling instruction of various kinds, and improving
the morals, as well as the understandings, of youth.</p>

<p>The natural and mechanic history, contained in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Spectacle de la Nature</span>, might also be begun in this
class, and continued through the subsequent classes, by
other books of the same kind; for, next to the know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>ledge
of duty, this kind of knowledge is certainly the
most useful, as well as the most entertaining. The
merchant may thereby be enabled better to understand
many commodities in trade; the handicraftsman, to improve
his business by new instruments, mixtures and
materials; and frequently hints are given for new manufactures,
or new methods of improving land, that
may be set on foot greatly to the advantage of a
country.</p>

<p class="center"><em>The Fourth Class</em></p>

<p>To be taught composition. Writing one's own language
well, is the next necessary accomplishment after
good speaking. It is the writing-master's business, to
take care that the boys make fair characters, and place
them straight and even in the lines: but to form their
style, and even to take care that the stops and capitals
are properly disposed, is the part of the English master.
The boys should be put on writing letters to each other
on any common occurrences, and on various subjects,
imaginary business, &amp;c. containing little stories, accounts
of their late reading, what parts of authors please
them, and why; letters of congratulation, of compliment,
of request, of thanks, of recommendation, of admonition,
of consolation, of expostulation, excuse, &amp;c.
In these, they should be taught to express themselves
clearly, concisely, and naturally, without affected words
or high-flown phrases. All their letters to pass through
the master's hand, who is to point out the faults, advise
the corrections, and commend what he finds right.
Some of the best letters published in our own language,
as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sir Willam Temple'">sir William Temple</ins>'s, those of Pope and his friends,
and some others, might be set before the youth as mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>dels,
their beauties pointed out and explained by the
master, the letters themselves transcribed by the scholar.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson's Ethices Elementa, or First Principles
of Morality, may now be read by the scholars, and explained
by the master, to lay a solid foundation of virtue
and piety in their minds. And as this class continues
the reading of history, let them now, at proper
hours, receive some farther instruction in chronology,
and in that part of geography (from the mathematical
master) which is necessary to understand the maps
and globes. They should also be acquainted with the
modern names of the places they find mentioned in ancient
writers. The exercises of good reading, and proper
speaking, still continued at suitable times.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Fifth Class</em></p>

<p>To improve the youth in composition, they may
now, besides continuing to write letters, begin to write
little essays in prose, and sometimes in verse; not to
make them poets, but for this reason, that nothing acquaints
a lad so speedily with variety of expression, as
the necessity of finding such words and phrases as will
suit the measure, sound and rhyme of verse, and at the
same time well express the sentiment. These essays
should all pass under the master's eye, who will point
out their faults, and put the writer on correcting them.
Where the judgment is not ripe enough for forming new
essays, let the sentiments of a Spectator be given, and
required to be clothed in the scholar's own words; or
the circumstances of some good story, the scholar to
find expression. Let them be put sometimes on abridging
a paragraph of a diffuse author: sometimes on dilating
or amplifying what is wrote more closely. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
now let Dr. Johnson's Noetica, or First Principles of
Human Knowledge, containing a logic, or art of reasoning,
&amp;c. be read by the youth, and the difficulties,
that may occur to them, be explained by the master.
The reading of history, and the exercises of good reading
and just speaking still continued.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Sixth Class</em></p>

<p>In this class, besides continuing the studies of the
preceding in history, rhetoric, logic, moral and natural
philosophy, the best English authors may be read and
explained; as Tillotson, Milton, Locke, Addison, Pope,
Swift, the higher papers in the Spectator and Guardian,
the best translations of Homer, Virgil and Horace, of
Telemachus, travels of Cyrus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Once a year, let there be public exercises in the hall;
the trustees and citizens present. Then let fine gilt
books be given as prizes to such boys, as distinguish
themselves, and excel the others in any branch of
learning, making three degrees of comparison: giving
the best prize to him, that performs best; a less valuable
one to him, that comes up next to the best, and
another to the third. Commendations, encouragement,
and advice to the rest; keeping up their hopes,
that, by industry, they may excel another time. The
names of those, that obtain the prize, to be yearly printed
in a list.</p>

<p>The hours of each day are to be divided and disposed
in such a manner, as that some classes may be with
the writing-master, improving their hands; others with
the mathematical master, learning arithmetic, accounts,
geography, use of the globes, drawing, mechanics, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
while the rest are in the English school, under the English
master's care.</p>

<p>Thus instructed, youth will come out of this school
fitted for learning any business, calling, or profession,
except such wherein languages are required: and,
though unacquainted with any ancient or foreign
tongue, they will be masters of their own, which is of
more immediate and general use, and withal will have
attained many other valuable accomplishments: the
time usually spent in acquiring those languages, often
without success, being here employed in laying such a
foundation of knowledge and ability, as, properly improved,
may qualify them to pass through and execute
the several offices of civil life, with advantage and
reputation to themselves and country.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Advice to Youth in Reading.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Craven-street, May 17, 1760.</em></p>

<p>I send my good girl the books I mentioned to her
last night. I beg her to accept of them as a small
mark of my esteem and friendship. They are written
in the familiar easy manner for which the French are
so remarkable, and afford a good deal of philosophic
and practical knowledge, unembarrassed with the dry
mathematics, used by more exact reasoners, but which
is apt to discourage young beginners. I would advise
you to read with a pen in your hand, and enter in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
little book short hints of what you find, that is curious,
or that may be useful; for this will be the best method
of imprinting such particulars in your memory, where
they will be ready, either for practice on some future
occasion, if they are matters of utility, or at least to
adorn and improve your conversation, if they are rather
points of curiosity. And as many of the terms of
science are such, as you cannot have met with in your
common reading, and may therefore be unacquainted
with, I think it would be well for you to have a good
dictionary at hand, to consult immediately when you
meet with a word you do not comprehend the precise
meaning of. This may at first seem troublesome and
interrupting; but it is a trouble that will daily diminish,
as you will daily find less and less occasion for your
dictionary as you become more acquainted with the
terms; and in the mean time you will read with more
satisfaction, because with more understanding. When
any point occurs, in which you would be glad to have
farther information than your book affords you, I beg
you would not in the least apprehend, that I should
think it a trouble to receive and answer your questions.
It will be a pleasure, and no trouble. For though I
may not be able, out of my own little stock of knowledge,
to afford you what you require, I can easily
direct you to the books, where it may most readily be
found. Adieu, and believe me ever, my dear friend,</p>

<p class="pfs80">Written in Pensylvania, 1751.</p>

<p>1. Tables of the proportion of marriages to births,
of deaths to births, of marriages to the number of
inhabitants, &amp;c. formed on observations made upon the
bills of mortality, christenings, &amp;c. of populous cities,
will not suit countries; nor will tables, formed on observations
made on full settled old countries, as Europe,
suit new countries, as America.</p>

<p>2. For people increase in proportion to the number
of marriages, and that is greater, in proportion to the
ease and convenience of supporting a family. When
families can be easily supported, more persons marry,
and earlier in life.</p>

<p>3. In cities, where all trades, occupations, and offices
are full, many delay marrying, till they can see how to
bear the charges of a family; which charges are greater
in cities, as luxury is more common; many live
single during life, and continue servants to families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
journeymen to trades, &amp;c. Hence cities do not, by
natural generation, supply themselves with inhabitants;
the deaths are more than the births.</p>

<p>4. In countries full settled, the case must be nearly
the same, all lands being occupied and improved to
the height; those who cannot get land, must labour for
others, that have it; when labourers are plenty, their
wages will be low; by low wages a family is supported
with difficulty; this difficulty deters many from marriage,
who therefore long continue servants and single.
Only, as the cities take supplies of people from the
country, and thereby make a little more room in the
country, marriage is a little more encouraged there,
and the births exceed the deaths.</p>

<p>5. Great part of Europe is fully, settled with husbandmen,
manufacturers, &amp;c. and therefore cannot now
much encrease in people. America is chiefly occupied
by Indians, who subsist mostly by hunting. But as
the hunter, of all men, requires the greatest quantity
of land from whence to draw his subsistence, (the husbandman
subsisting on much less, the gardener on still
less, and the manufacturer requiring least of all) the
Europeans found America as fully settled, as it well
could be by hunters; yet these, having large tracts,
were easily prevailed on to part with portions of territory
to the new comers, who did not much interfere
with the natives in hunting, and furnished them with
many things they wanted.</p>

<p>6. Land being thus plenty in America, and so cheap,
as that a labouring man, that understands husbandry,
can, in a short time, save money enough to purchase a
piece of new land, sufficient for a plantation, whereon
he may subsist a family; such are not afraid to marry;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
for if they even look far enough forward to consider
how their children, when grown up, are to be provided
for, they see, that more land is to be had at rates
equally easy, all circumstances considered.</p>

<p>7. Hence marriages in America are more general,
and more generally early, than in Europe. And if it
is reckoned there, that there is but one marriage <em>per
annum</em> among 100 persons, perhaps we may here
reckon two; and if in Europe, they have but four births
to a marriage, (many of their marriages being late) we
may here reckon eight, of which, if one half grow up,
and our marriages are made, reckoning one with another,
at twenty years of age, our people must at least
be doubled every twenty years.</p>

<p>8. But notwithstanding this increase, so vast is the
territory of North America, that it will require many
ages to settle it fully, and till it is fully settled, labour
will never be cheap here, where no man continues long
a labourer for others, but gets a plantation of his own;
no man continues long a journeyman to a trade, but
goes among those new settlers, and sets up for himself,
&amp;c. Hence labour is no cheaper now, in Pensylvania,
than it was thirty years ago, though so many thousand
labouring people have been imported from Germany
and Ireland.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '6. The danger'">9. The danger</ins>, therefore, of these colonies interfering
with their mother country in trades, that depend on
labour, manufactures, &amp;c. is too remote to require the
attention of Great Britain.</p>

<p>10. But, in proportion to the increase of the colonies,
a vast demand is growing for British manufactures; a
glorious market, wholly in the power of Britain, in
which foreigners cannot interfere, which will increase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
in a short time, even beyond her power of supplying,
though her whole trade should be to her colonies.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>12. It is an ill-grounded opinion, that, by the labour
of slaves, America may possibly vie in cheapness of
manufactures with Britain. The labour of slaves can
never be so cheap here, as the labour of working men
is in Britain. Any one may compute it. Interest of
money is in the colonies from 6 to 10 per cent. Slaves,
one with another, cost 30<i>l.</i> sterling per head. Reckon
then the interest of the first purchase of a slave, the
insurance or risque on his life, his clothing and diet,
expences in his sickness, and loss of time, loss by his
neglect of business, (neglect is natural to the man, who
is not to be benefited by his own care or diligence)
expence of a driver to keep him at work, and his pilfering
from time to time, almost every slave being,
from the nature of slavery, a thief, and compare the
whole amount with the wages of a manufacturer of
iron or wool in England, you will see, that labour is
much cheaper there, than it ever can be by negroes
here. Why then will Americans purchase slaves? Because
slaves may be kept as long as a man pleases, or
has occasion for their labour, while hired men are continually
leaving their master (often in the midst of his
business) and setting up for themselves. §8.</p>

<p>13. As the increase of people depends on the encouragement
of marriages, the following things must diminish
a nation, viz. 1. The being conquered; for the
conquerors will engross as many offices, and exact as
much tribute or profit on the labour of the conquered,
as will maintain them in their new establishment; and
this diminishing the subsistence of the natives discou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>rages
their marriages, and so gradually diminishes
them, while the foreigners increase. 2. Loss of territory.
Thus the Britons, being driven into Wales, and
crouded together in a barren country, insufficient to
support such great numbers, diminished, till the people
bore a proportion to the produce; while the Saxons
increased on then abandoned lands, till the island became
full of English. And, were the English now
driven into Wales by some foreign nation, there would,
in a few years, be no more Englishmen in Britain, than
there are now people in Wales. 3. Loss of trade.
Manufactures, exported, draw subsistence from foreign
countries for numbers, who are thereby enabled to
marry and raise families. If the nation be deprived of
any branch of trade, and no new employment is found
for the people occupied in that branch, it will soon be
deprived of so many people. 4. Loss of food. Suppose
a nation has a fishery, which not only employs
great numbers, but makes the food and subsistence of
the people cheaper: if another nation becomes master
of the seas, and prevents the fishery, the people will
diminish in proportion as the loss of employ and dearness
of provision makes it more difficult to subsist a
family. 5. Bad government and insecure property.
People not only leave such a country, and, settling
abroad, incorporate with other nations, lose their native
language, and become foreigners; but the industry of
those that remain being discouraged, the quantity of
subsistence in the country is lessened, and the support
of a family becomes more difficult. So heavy taxes
tend to diminish a people. 6. The introduction of
slaves. The negroes, brought into the English sugar
islands, have greatly diminished the whites there; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
poor are by this means deprived of employment, while
a few families acquire vast estates, which they spend
on foreign luxuries; and, educating their children in the
habit of those luxuries, the same income is needed for
the support of one, that might have maintained one
hundred. The whites, who have slaves, not labouring;
are enfeebled, and therefore not so generally prolific;
the slaves being worked too hard, and ill fed, their constitutions
are broken, and the deaths among them are
more than the births; so that a continual supply is
needed from Africa. The northern colonies, having few
slaves, increase in whites. Slaves also pejorate the
families that use them; the white children become
proud, disgusted with labour, and, being educated in
idleness, are rendered unfit to get a living by industry.</p>

<p>14. Hence the prince, that acquires new territory, if
he finds it vacant, or removes the natives to give his
own people room;&mdash;the legislator, that makes effectual
laws for promoting of trade, increasing employment,
improving land by more or better tillage, providing
more food by fisheries, securing property, &amp;c.&mdash;and the
man that invents new trades, arts or manufactures, or
new improvements in husbandry, may be properly
called <em>fathers of their nation</em>, as they are the cause of
the generation of multitudes, by the encouragement
they afford to marriage.</p>

<p>15. As to privileges granted to the married, (such as
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus trium liberorum</i> among the Romans) they may
hasten the filling of a country, that has been thinned by
war or pestilence, or that has otherwise vacant territory,
but cannot increase a people beyond the means provided
for their subsistence.</p>

<p>16. Foreign luxuries, and needless manufactures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
imported and used in a nation, do, by the same reasoning,
increase the people of the nation, that furnishes
them, and diminish the people of the nation, that uses
them. Laws, therefore, that prevent such importations,
and, on the contrary, promote the exportation of
manufactures to be consumed in foreign countries, may
be called (with respect to the people that make them)
<em>generative laws</em>, as, by increasing subsistence, they encourage
marriage. Such laws likewise strengthen a
country doubly, by increasing its own people, and
diminishing its neighbours.</p>

<p>17. Some European nations prudently refuse to consume
the manufactures of East India:&mdash;they should
likewise forbid them to their colonies; for the gain to
the merchant is not to be compared with the loss, by
this means, of people to the nation.</p>

<p>18. Home luxury in the great increases the nation's
manufacturers employed by it, who are many, and only
tends to diminish the families that indulge in it, who
are few. The greater the common fashionable expence
of any rank of people, the more cautious they
are of marriage. Therefore luxury should never be
suffered to become common.</p>

<p>19. The great increase of offspring in particular
families is not always owing to greater fecundity of
nature, but sometimes to examples of industry in the
heads, and industrious education, by which the children
are enabled to provide better for themselves, and their
marrying early is encouraged from the prospect of good
subsistence.</p>

<p>20. If there be a sect, therefore, in our nation, that
regard frugality and industry as religious duties, and
educate their children therein, more than others com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>monly
do, such sect must consequently increase more
by natural generation than any other sect in Britain.</p>

<p>21. The importation of foreigners into a country,
that has as many inhabitants as the present employments
and provisions for subsistence will bear, will be
in the end no increase of people, unless the new-comers
have more industry and frugality than the natives, and
then they will provide more subsistence, and increase
in the country; but they will gradually eat the natives
out.&mdash;Nor is it necessary to bring in foreigners to fill
up any occasional vacancy in a country; for such vacancy
(if the laws are good, § 14, 16) will soon be filled
by natural generation. Who can now find the vacancy
made in Sweden, France, or other warlike nations, by
the plague of heroism 40 years ago; in France, by the
expulsion of the protestants; in England, by the settlement
of her colonies; or in Guinea by a hundred years
exportation of slaves, that has blackened half America?
The thinness of the inhabitants in Spain is owing
to national pride, and idleness, and other causes, rather
than to the expulsion, of the Moors, or to the making
of new settlements.</p>

<p>22. There is, in short, no bound to the prolific nature
of plants or animals, but what is made by their crowding
and interfering with each other's means of subsistence.
Was the face of the earth vacant of other
plants, it might be gradually sowed and the overspread
with one kind only, as for instance, with fennel; and
were it empty of other inhabitants, it might, in a few
ages, be replenished from one nation only, as for instance,
with Englishmen. Thus there are supposed to
be now upwards of one million of English souls in
North America (though it is thought scarce 80,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
have been brought over sea) and yet perhaps there is
not one the fewer in Britain, but rather many more,
on account of the employment the colonies afford to
manufacturers at home. This million doubling, suppose
but once in 25 years, will, in another century, be
more than the people of England, and the greatest
number of Englishmen will be on this side the water.
What an accession of power to the British empire by
sea as well as land! What increase of trade and navigation!
What numbers of ships and seamen! We have
been here but little more than a hundred years, and
yet the force of our privateers in the late war, united,
was greater, both in men and guns, than that of the
whole British navy in queen Elizabeth's time. How
important an affair then to Britain is the present
treaty<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> for settling the bounds between her colonies
and the French! and how careful should she be to
secure, room enough, since on the room depends so
much the increase of her people?</p>

<p>23. In fine, a nation well regulated is like a polypus<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>,
take away a limb, its place is soon supplied; cut
it in two, and each deficient part shall speedily grow
out of the part remaining. Thus, if you have room
and subsistence enough, as you may, by dividing, make
ten polypuses out of one, you may, of one, make ten
nations, equally populous and powerful; or, rather,
increase a nation tenfold in numbers and strength.</p>

ESQ. AT PHILADELPHIA.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Remarks on some of the foregoing Observations, showing particularly
the Effect which manners have on Population.</em></a></h3>

<p class="fs60 pad2">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>It is now near three years since I received your excellent
<cite>Observations on the Increase of Mankind</cite>, &amp;c. in
which you have with so much sagacity and accuracy
shown in what manner, and by what causes, that principal
means of political grandeur is best promoted; and
have so well supported those just inferences you have
occasionally drawn, concerning the general state of our
American colonies, and the views and conduct of some
of the inhabitants of Great Britain.</p>

<p>You have abundantly proved, that natural fecundity
is hardly to be considered, because the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis generandi</i>,
as far as we know, is unlimited, and because experience
shows, that the numbers of nations is altogether governed
by collateral causes, and among these none of
so much force as quantity of subsistence, whether
arising from climate, soil, improvement of tillage,
trade, fisheries, secure property, conquest of new countries,
or other favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>As I perfectly concurred with you in your sentiments
on these heads, I have been very desirous of building
somewhat on the foundation you have there laid; and
was induced, by your hints in the twenty-first section,
to trouble you with some thoughts on the influence
manners have always had, and are always likely to have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
on the numbers of a people, and their political prosperity
in general.</p>

<p>The end of every individual is its own private good.
The rules it observes in the pursuit of this good are a
system of propositions, almost every one founded in
authority, that is, derive their weight from the credit
given to one or more persons, and not from demonstration.</p>

<p>And this, in the most important as well as the other
affairs of life, is the case even of the wisest and philosophical
part of the human species; and that it should be
so is the less strange, when we consider, that it is perhaps
impossible to prove, that <em>being</em>, or life itself, has
any other value than what is set on it by authority.</p>

<p>A confirmation of this may be derived from the observation,
that, in every country in the universe, happiness
is sought upon a different plan; and, even in the
same country, we see it placed by different ages, professions,
and ranks of men, in the attainment of enjoyments
utterly unlike.</p>

<p>These propositions, as well as others framed upon
them, become habitual by degrees, and, as they govern
the determination of the will, I call them <em>moral habits</em>.</p>

<p>There are another set of habits, that have the direction
of the members of the body, that I call therefore
<em>mechanical habits</em>. These compose what we commonly
call <em>the arts</em>, which are more or less liberal or mechanical,
as they more or less partake of assistance from the
operations of the mind.</p>

<p>The <em>cumulus</em> of the moral habits of each individual
is the manners of that individual; the <em>cumulus</em> of the
manners of individuals makes up the manners of a
nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>The happiness of individuals is evidently the
end of political society; and political welfare, or the
strength, splendour, and opulence of the state, have been
always admitted, both by political writers, and the valuable
part of mankind in general, to conduce to this
end, and are therefore desirable.</p>

<p>The causes, that advance or obstruct any one of these
three objects, are external or internal. The latter may
be divided into physical, civil, and personal, under
which last head I comprehend the moral and mechanical
habits of mankind. The physical causes are principally
climate, soil, and number of subjects; the civil,
are government and laws; and political welfare is always
in a ratio composed of the force of these particular
causes; a multitude of external causes, and all these
internal ones, not only control and qualify, but are
constantly acting on, and thereby insensibly, as well as
sensibly, altering one another, both for the better and
the worse, and this not excepting the climate itself.</p>

<p>The powerful efficacy of manners in encreasing a
people is manifest from the instance you mention, the
Quakers; among them industry and frugality multiply
and extend the use of the necessaries of life; to manners
of a like kind are owing the populousness of Holland,
Switzerland, China, Japan, and most parts of Indostan,
&amp;c. in every one of which, the force of extent
of territory and fertility of soil is multiplied, or their
want compensated by industry and frugality.</p>

<p>Neither nature nor art have contributed much to the
production of subsistence in Switzerland, yet we see
frugality preserves and even increases families, that live
on their fortunes, and which, in England, we call the
gentry; and the observation we cannot but make in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the southern part of this kingdom, that those families,
including all superior ones, are gradually becoming extinct,
affords the clearest proof, that luxury (that is, a
greater expence of subsistence than in prudence a man
ought to consume) is as destructive as a proportionable
want of it; but in Scotland, as in Switzerland, the gentry,
though one with another they have not one-fourth
of the income, increase in number.</p>

<p>And here I cannot help remarking, by the by, how
well founded your distinction is between the increase of
mankind in old and new settled countries in general,
and more particularly in the case of families of condition.
In America, where the expences are more confined,
to necessaries, and those necessaries are cheap, it
is common to see above one hundred persons descended
from one living old man. In England, it frequently
happens, where a man has seven, eight, or more children,
there has not been a descendant in the next generation,
occasioned by the difficulties the number of
children has brought on the family, in a luxurious dear
country, and which have prevented their marrying.</p>

<p>That this is more owing to luxury than mere want
appears from what I have said of Scotland, and more
plainly from parts of England remote from London, in
most of which the necessaries of life are nearly as dear,
in some dearer than London, yet the people of all ranks
marry and breed up children.</p>

<p>Again; among the lower ranks of life, none produce
so few children as servants. This is, in some measure,
to be attributed to their situation, which hinders marriage,
but is also to be attributed to their luxury and
corruption of manners, which are greater than among
any other set of people in England, and is the conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>quence
of a nearer view of the lives and persons of a
superior rank, than any inferior rank, without a proper
education, ought to have.</p>

<p>The quantity of subsistence in England has unquestionably
become greater for many ages; and yet if the
inhabitants are more numerous, they certainly are not
so in proportion to our improvement of the means of
support. I am apt to think there are few parts of this
kingdom, that have not been at some former time more
populous than at present. I have several cogent reasons
for thinking so of great part of the counties I am
most intimately acquainted with; but as they were probably
not all most populous at the same time, and as
some of our towns are visibly and vastly grown in bulk,
I dare not suppose, as judicious men have done, that
England is less peopled than heretofore.</p>

<p>This growth of our towns is the effect of a change
of manners, and improvement of arts, common to all
Europe; and though it is not imagined, that it has lessened
the country growth of necessaries, it has evidently,
by introducing a greater consumption of them,
(an infallible consequence of a nation's dwelling in
towns) counteracted the effects of our prodigious advances
in the arts.</p>

<p>But however frugality may supply the place, or
prodigality counteract the effects, of the natural or acquired
subsistence of a country, industry is, beyond
doubt, a more efficacious cause of plenty than any natural
advantage of extent or fertility. I have mentioned
instances of frugality and industry united with
extent and fertility. In Spain and Asia Minor, we see
frugality joined to extent and fertility, without industry;
in Ireland, we once saw the same; Scotland had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
then none of them but frugality. The change in
these two countries is obvious to every one, and it is
owing to industry not yet very widely diffused in either.
The effects of industry and frugality in England are
surprising; both the rent and the value of the inheritance
of land depend on them greatly more than on nature,
and this, though there is no considerable difference in
the prices of our markets. Land of equal goodness lets
for double the rent of other land lying in the same
county, and there are many years purchase difference
between different counties, where rents are equally well
paid and secure.</p>

<p>Thus manners operate upon the number of inhabitants,
but of their silent effects upon a civil constitution,
history, and even our own experience, yields us
abundance of proofs, though they are not uncommonly
attributed to external causes: their support of a government
against external force is so great, that it is a common
maxim among the advocates of liberty, that no
free government was ever dissolved, or overcome, before
the manners of its subjects were corrupted.</p>

<p>The superiority of Greece over Persia was singly
owing to their difference of manners; and that, though
all natural advantages were on the side of the latter,
to which I might add the civil ones; for though the
greatest of all civil advantages, liberty, was on the side
of Greece, yet that added no political strength to her,
than as it operated on her manners, and, when they
were corrupted, the restoration of their liberty by the
Romans, overturned the remains of their power.</p>

<p>Whether the manners of ancient Rome were at any
period calculated to promote the happiness of indivi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>duals,
it is not my design to examine; but that their
manners, and the effects of those manners on their government
and public conduct, founded, enlarged, and
supported, and afterwards overthrew their empire, is
beyond all doubt. One of the effects of their conquest
furnishes us with a strong proof, how prevalent
manners are even beyond quantity of subsistence; for,
when the custom of bestowing on the citizens of Rome
corn enough to support themselves and families was
become established, and Egypt and Sicily produced the
grain, that fed the inhabitants of Italy, this became less
populous every day, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus trium liberorum</i> was
but an expedient, that could not balance the want of industry
and frugality.</p>

<p>But corruption of manners did not only thin the inhabitants
of the Roman empire, it rendered the remainder
incapable of defence, long before its fall, perhaps
before the dissolution of the republic; so that without
standing disciplined armies, composed of men, whose
moral habits principally, and mechanical habits secondarily,
made them different from the body of the people,
the Roman empire had been a prey to the barbarians
many ages before it was.</p>

<p>By the mechanical habits of the soldiery, I mean
their discipline, and the art of war; and that this is
but a secondary quality appears from the inequality
that has in all ages been between raw, though well disciplined
armies, and veterans, and more from the irresistible
force a single moral habit, religion, has conferred
on troops, frequently neither disciplined nor experienced.</p>

<p>The military manners of the noblesse in France, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>pose
the chief force of that kingdom, and the enterprising
manners and restless dispositions of the inhabitants
of Canada have enabled a handful of men to harass
our populous, and, generally, less martial colonies;
yet neither are of the value they seem at first sight, because
overbalanced by the defect they occasion of other
habits, that would produce more eligible political good:
and military manners in a people are not necessary in
an age and country where such manners may be occasionally
formed and preserved among men enough to
defend the state; and such a country is Great Britain,
where, though the lower class of people are by no means
of a military cast, yet they make better soldiers than
even the noblesse of France.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this country, a few ages back,
were to the populous and rich provinces of France,
what Canada is now to the British colonies. It is true,
there was less disproportion between their natural
strength; but I mean, that the riches of France were a
real weakness, opposed to the military manners founded
upon poverty and a rugged disposition, then the character
of the English; But it must be remembered, that
at this time the manners of a people were not distinct
from that of their soldiery, for the use of standing
armies has deprived a military people of the advantages
they before had over others; and though it has been
often said, that civil wars give power, because they render
all men soldiers, I believe this has only been found
true in internal wars following civil wars, and not in external
ones; for now, in foreign wars, a small army, with
ample means to support it, is of greater force than one
more numerous, with less. This last fact has often happened
between France and Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>The means of supporting armies, and consequently
the power of exerting external strength, are best found
in the industry and frugality of the body of a people
living under a government and laws, that encourage
commerce: for commerce is at this day almost the only
stimulus, that forces every one to contribute a share of
labour for the public benefit.</p>

<p>But such is the human frame, and the world is so
constituted, that it is a hard matter to possess ones self
of a benefit, without laying ones self open to a loss on
some other side; the improvements of manners of one
sort often deprave those of another: thus we see industry
and frugality under the influence of commerce,
which I call a commercial spirit, tend to destroy, as
well as support, the government it flourishes under.</p>

<p>Commerce perfects the arts, but more the mechanical
than the liberal, and this for an obvious reason; it
softens and enervates the manners. Steady virtue and
unbending integrity are seldom to be found where a
spirit of commerce pervades every thing; yet the perfection
of commerce is, that every thing should have
its price. We every day see its progress, both to our
benefit and detriment here. Things, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boni mores</i> forbid
to be set to sale, are become its objects, and there
are few things indeed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra commercium</i>. The legislative
power itself has been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in commercio</i>, and church livings
are seldom given without consideration, even by
sincere Christians, and, for consideration, not seldom to
very unworthy persons. The rudeness of ancient military
times and the fury of more modern enthusiastic
ones are worn off; even the spirit of forensic contention
is astonishingly diminished, all marks of manners softening;
but luxury and corruption have taken their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
places, and seem the inseparable companions of commerce
and the arts.</p>

<p>I cannot help observing, however, that this is much
more the case in extensive countries, especially at their
metropolis, than in other places. It is an old observation
of politicians, and frequently made by historians,
that small states always best preserve their manners.
Whether this happens from the greater room there is for
attention in the legislature, or from the less room there
is for ambition and avarice, it is a strong argument,
among others, against an incorporating union of the
colonies in America, or even a federal one, that may
tend to the future reducing them under one government.</p>

<p>Their power, while disunited, is less, but their liberty;
as well as manners, is more secure; and, considering
the little danger of any conquest to be made upon them,
I had rather they should suffer something through disunion,
than see them under a general administration
less equitable than that concerted at Albany<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>I take it, the inhabitants of Pensylvania are both
frugal and industrious beyond those of any province in
America. If luxury should spread, it cannot be extirpated
by laws. We are told by Plutarch, that Plato
used to say, <em>It was a hard thing to make laws for the
Cyrenians, a people abounding in plenty and opulence</em>.</p>

<p>But from what I set out with, it is evident, if I be
not mistaken, that education only can stem the torrent,
and, without checking either true industry or frugality,
prevent the sordid frugality and laziness of the old Irish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and many of the modern Scotch, (I mean the inhabitants
of that country, those who leave it for another
being generally industrious) or the industry, mixed
with luxury, of this capital, from getting ground, and,
by rendering ancient manners familiar, produce a reconciliation
between disinterestedness and commerce;
a thing we often see, but almost always in men of a liberal
education.</p>

<p>To conclude: when we would form a people, soil
and climate may be found at least sufficiently good;
inhabitants may be encouraged to settle, and even supported
for a while; a good government and laws may
be framed, and even arts may be established, or their
produce imported: but many necessary moral habits
are hardly ever found among those who voluntary offer
themselves in times of quiet at home, to people new colonies;
besides that the moral, as well as mechanical
habits adapted to a mother country are frequently not
so to the new settled one, and to external events, many
of which are always unforeseen. Hence it is we have
seen such fruitless attempts to settle colonies, at an immense
public and private expence, by several of the
powers of Europe: and it is particularly observable,
that none of the English colonies became any way considerable,
till the necessary manners were born and grew
up in the country, excepting those to which singular
circumstances at home forced manners fit for the forming
a new state.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Plan, by Messieurs Franklin and Dalrymple, for benefitting distant
unprovided Countries</em></a><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>Aug. 29, 1771.</em></p>

<p>The country called in the maps New Zealand has
been discovered by the Endeavour, to be two islands,
together as large as Great Britain: these islands, named
Acpy-nomawée and Tovy-poennammoo, are inhabited
by a brave and generous race, who are destitute of
<em>corn</em>, <em>fowls</em>, and <em>all quadrupeds</em>, except <em>dogs</em>.</p>

<p>These circumstances being mentioned lately in a
company of men of liberal sentiments, it was observed,
that it seemed incumbent on such a country as this, to
communicate to all others the conveniences of life,
which we enjoy.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin, whose life has ever been directed to
promote the true interest of society, said, "he would
with all his heart <em>subscribe</em> to a voyage intended to communicate
<em>in general</em> those benefits, which we enjoy, to
countries destitute of them in the remote parts of the
globe." This proposition being warmly adopted by the
rest of the company, Mr. Dalrymple, then present, was
induced to offer to undertake the command on such an
expedition.</p>

<p>On mature reflection, this scheme appears the more
honourable to the national character of any which can
be conceived, as it is grounded on the noblest principle
of benevolence. Good intentions are often frustrated
by letting them remain indigested; on this consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Mr. Dalrymple was induced to put the outlines on
paper, which are now published, that by an early communication
there, may be a better opportunity of collecting
all the hints, which can conduce to execute effectually
the benevolent purpose of the expedition, in
case it should meet with general approbation.</p>

<p>On this scheme being shown to Dr. Franklin, he
communicated his sentiments, by way of introduction,
to the following effect:</p>

<p>"Britain is said to have produced originally nothing
but <em>sloes</em>. What vast advantages have been communicated
to her by the fruits, seeds, roots, herbage, animals,
and arts of other countries! We are by their
means become a wealthy and a mighty nation, abounding
in all good things. Does not some <em>duty</em> hence arise
from us towards other countries, still remaining in our
former state?</p>

<p>"Britain is now the first maritime power in the
world. Her ships are innumerable, capable by their
form, size, and strength, of sailing all seas. Our seamen
are equally bold, skilful, and hardy; dexterous in
exploring the remotest regions, and ready to engage in
voyages to unknown countries, though attended with
the greatest dangers. The inhabitants of those countries,
our <em>fellow men</em>, have canoes only; not knowing
iron, they cannot build ships; they have little astronomy,
and no knowledge of the compass to guide them;
they cannot therefore come to us, or obtain any of our
advantages. From these circumstances, does not some
duty seem to arise from us to them? Does not Providence,
by these distinguishing favours, seem to call on
us, to do something ourselves for the common interest
of humanity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those who think it their duty, to ask bread and
other blessings daily from heaven, would they not
think it equally a duty, to communicate of those blessings
when they have received them, and show their
gratitude to their great Benefactor by the only means
in their power, promoting the happiness of his other
children?</p>

<p>"Ceres is said to have made a journey through many
countries to teach the use of corn, and the art of raising
it. For this single benefit the grateful nations deified
her. How much more may Englishmen deserve
such honour, by communicating the knowledge and use
not of corn only, but of all the other enjoyments earth
can produce, and which they are now in possession
of. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Communiter bona profundere, Deum est.</i></p>

<p>"Many voyages have been undertaken with views of
profit or of plunder, or to gratify resentment; to procure
some advantage to ourselves, or do some mischief
to others: but a voyage is now proposed, to visit a distant
people on the other side the globe; not to cheat
them, not to rob them, not to seize their lands, or enslave
their persons; but merely to do them good, and
make them, as far as in our power lies, to live as comfortably
as ourselves.</p>

<p>"It seems a laudable wish, that all the nations of the
earth were connected by a knowledge of each other,
and a mutual exchange of benefits: but a commercial
nation particularly should wish for a general civilization
of mankind, since trade is always carried on to much
greater extent with people who have the arts and conveniences
of life, than it can be with naked savages.
We may therefore hope, in this undertaking, to be of,
some service to our country, as well as to those poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
people, who, however distant from us, are in truth related
to us, and whose interests do, in some degree, concern
every one who can say, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sum, &amp;c.</i>"</p>

<p><em>Scheme of a voyage, by subscription</em>, to convey the
conveniences of life, as fowls, hogs, goats, cattle, corn,
iron, &amp;c., to those remote regions, which are destitute of
them, and to bring from thence such productions, as
can be cultivated in this kingdom to the advantage of
society, in a ship under the command of Alexander
Dalrymple.</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>Concerning the Provision made in China against Famine.</em></a></h3>

<p>I have somewhere read, that in China an account
is yearly taken of the number of people, and the quantities
of provision produced. This account is transmitted
to the emperor, whose ministers can thence
foresee a scarcity, likely to happen in any province, and
from what province it can best be supplied in good
time. To facilitate the collecting of this account, and
prevent the necessity of entering houses and spending
time in asking and answering questions, each house is
furnished with a little board, to be hung without the
door during a certain time each year; on which board
are marked certain words, against which the inhabitant
is to mark number and quantity, somewhat in this
manner:</p>

<div class="bbox2">
<p class="noindent pad1">Men,<br />
Women,<br />
Children,<br />
Rice, or Wheat,<br />
Flesh, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>All under sixteen are accounted children, and all
above, men and women. Any other particulars, which
the government desires information of, are occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
marked on the same boards. Thus the officers, appointed
to collect the accounts in each district, have
only to pass before the doors, and enter into their book
what they find marked on the board, without giving
the least trouble to the family. There is a penalty on
marking falsely, and as neighbours must know nearly
the truth of each others account, they dare not expose
themselves, by a false one, to each others accusation.
Perhaps such a regulation is scarcely practicable

<p>1. All food or subsistence for mankind arise from
the earth or waters.</p>

<p>2. Necessaries of life, that are not foods, and all
other conveniences, have their values estimated by the
proportion of food consumed while we are employed
in procuring them.</p>

<p>3. A small people, with a large territory, may subsist
on the productions of nature, with no other labour than
that of gathering the vegetables and catching the
animals.</p>

<p>4. A large people, with a small territory, finds these
insufficient, and, to subsist, must labour the earth, to
make it produce greater quantities of vegetable food,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>suitable for the nourishment of men, and of the animals
they intend to eat.</p>

<p>5. From this labour arises a <em>great increase</em> of vegetable
and animal food, and of materials for clothing, as
flax, wool, silk, &amp;c. The superfluity of these is wealth.
With this wealth we pay for the labour employed in
building our houses, cities, &amp;c. which are therefore only
subsistence thus metamorphosed.</p>

<p>6. <em>Manufactures</em> are only <em>another shape</em> into which so
much provisions and subsistence are turned, as were
equal in value to the manufactures produced. This
appears from hence, that the manufacturer does not, in
fact, obtain from the employer, for his labour, <em>more</em>
than a mere subsistence, including raiment, fuel, and
shelter: all which derive their value from the provisions
consumed in procuring them.</p>

<p>7. The produce of the earth, thus converted into
manufactures, may be more easily carried to distant
markets than before such conversion.</p>

<p>8. <em>Fair commerce</em> is, where equal values are exchanged
for equal, the expence of transport included.
Thus, if it costs A in England as much labour and
charge to raise a bushel of wheat, as it costs B in
France to produce four gallons of wine, then are four
gallons of wine the fair exchange for a bushel of wheat,
A and B meeting at half distance with their commodities
to make the exchange. The advantage of this fair
commerce is, that each party increases the number of
his enjoyments, having, instead of wheat alone, or wine
alone, the use of both wheat and wine.</p>

<p>9. Where the labour and expence of producing both
commodities are known to both parties, bargains will
generally be fair and equal. Where they are known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
one party only, bargains will often be unequal, knowledge
taking its advantage of ignorance.</p>

<p>10. Thus he, that carries one thousand bushels of
wheat abroad to sell, may not probably obtain so great
a profit thereon, as if he had first turned the wheat into
manufactures, by subsisting therewith the workmen
while producing those manufactures: since there are
many expediting and facilitating methods of working,
not generally known; and strangers to the manufactures,
though they know pretty well the expence of
raising wheat, are unacquainted with those short methods
of working, and thence, being apt to suppose more
labour employed in the manufactures than there really
is, are more easily imposed on in their value, and induced
to allow more for them than they are honestly
worth.</p>

<p>11. Thus the advantage of having manufactures in a
country does not consist, as is commonly supposed, in
their highly advancing the value of rough materials, of
which they are formed; since, though six-pennyworth
of flax may be worth twenty shillings when worked into
lace, yet the very cause of its being worth twenty shillings,
is, that, besides the flax, it has cost nineteen shillings
and sixpence in subsistence to the manufacturer.
But the advantage of manufactures is, that under their
shape provisions may be more easily carried to a foreign
market; and by their means our traders may more
easily cheat strangers. Few, where it is not made, are
judges of the value of lace. The importer may demand
forty, and perhaps get thirty shillings for that, which
cost him but twenty.</p>

<p>12. Finally, there seem to be but three ways for a
nation to acquire wealth. The first is by <em>war</em>, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Romans did, in plundering their conquered neighbours.
This is <em>robbery</em>.&mdash;The second by <em>commerce</em>, which is generally
<em>cheating</em>.&mdash;The third by <em>agriculture</em>, the only
<em>honest way</em>, wherein man receives a real increase of the
seed thrown into the ground, in a kind of continual miracle
wrought by the hand of God in his favour, as a
reward for his innocent life, and his virtuous industry.</p>

<p class="center">[§ 1. <em>Of the Employment of Time, and of Indolence:
particularly as respecting the State.</em>]</p>

<p>All that live must be subsisted. Subsistence costs
something. He, that is industrious, produces, by his industry,
something that is an equivalent, and pays for
his subsistence: he is therefore no charge or burden to
society. The indolent are an expence uncompensated.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but all kinds of employment,
that can be followed without prejudice from interruptions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
work, that can be taken up, and laid down, often
in a day, without damage; (such as spinning, knitting,
weaving, &amp;c.) are highly advantageous to a community;
because in them may be collected all the produce
of those fragments of time, that occur in family-business,
between the constant and necessary parts of
it, that usually occupy females; as the time between
rising and preparing for breakfast, between breakfast
and preparing for dinner, &amp;c. &amp;c. The amount of all
these fragments is, in the course of a year, very considerable
to a single family; to a state proportionably.
Highly profitable therefore it is, in this case also, to
follow that divine direction, <em>gather up the fragments that
nothing be lost</em>. Lost time is lost subsistence; it is
therefore lost treasure.</p>

<p>Hereby, in several families, many yards of linen have
been produced, from the employment of those fragments
only, in one year, though such families were just the
same in number as when not so employed.</p>

<p>It was an excellent saying of a certain Chinese emperor,
<em>I will, if possible, have no idleness in my dominions;
for if there be one man idle, some man must suffer
cold or hunger</em>. We take this emperor's meaning to be,
that the labour due to the public by each individual,
not being performed by the indolent, must naturally
fall to the share of others, who must thereby suffer.</p>

<p class="center">[§ 2. <em>Of Embargoes upon Corn, and of the Poor.</em>]</p>

<p>In inland high countries, remote from the sea, and
whose rivers are small, running <em>from</em> the country, and
not <em>to</em> it, as is the case of Switzerland, great distress
may arise from a course of bad harvests, if public granaries
are not provided, and kept well stored. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>ciently
too, before navigation was so general, ships so
plenty, and commercial connections so well established,
even maritime countries might be occasionally distressed
by bad crops. But such is now the facility of communication
between those countries, that an unrestrained
commerce can scarce ever fail of procuring a
sufficiency for any of them. If indeed any government
is so imprudent, as to lay its hands on imported corn,
forbid its exportation, or compel its sale at limited prices,
there the people may suffer some famine from merchants
avoiding their ports. But wherever commerce
is known to be always free, and the merchant absolute
master of his commodity, as in Holland, there will
always be a reasonable supply.</p>

<p>When an exportation of corn takes place, occasioned
by a higher price in some foreign countries, it is common
to raise a clamour, on the supposition, that we shall
thereby produce a domestic famine. Then follows a
prohibition, founded on the imaginary distress of the
poor. The poor, to be sure, if in distress, should be
relieved; but if the farmer could have a high price for
his corn from the foreign demand, must he, by a prohibition
of exportation, be compelled to take a low price,
not of the poor only, but of every one that eats bread,
even the richest? the duty of relieving the poor is incumbent
on the rich; but by this operation the whole
burden of it is laid on the farmer, who is to relieve the
rich at the same time. Of the poor too, those, who are
maintained by the parishes, have no right to claim this
sacrifice of the farmer; as, while they have their allowance,
it makes no difference to them, whether bread be
cheap or dear. Those working poor, who now mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
business only <em>five</em> or <em>four</em> days in the week, if bread
should be so dear, as to oblige them to work the whole
<em>six</em> required by the commandment, do not seem to be
aggrieved, so as to have a right to public redress.
There will then remain, comparatively, only a few families
in every district, who, from sickness, or a great
number of children, will be so distressed by a high price
of corn, as to need relief; and these should be taken
care of by particular benefactions, without restraining
the farmer's profit.</p>

<p>Those, who fear, that exportation may so far drain
the country of corn, as to starve ourselves, fear what
never did, nor ever can happen. They may as well,
when they view the tide ebbing towards the sea, fear,
that all the water will leave the river. The price of
corn, like water, will find its own level. The more we
export, the dearer it becomes at home; the more is received
abroad, the cheaper it becomes there; and as
soon as these prices are equal, the exportation stops of
course. As the seasons vary in different countries, the
calamity of a bad harvest is never universal. If then,
all ports were always open, and all commerce free, every
maritime country would generally eat bread at the medium
price, or average of all the harvests; which would
probably be more equal than we can make it by out
artificial regulations, and therefore a more steady encouragement
to agriculture. The nation would all have
bread at this middle price; and that nation, which at
any time inhumanely refuses to relieve the distresses of
another nation, deserves no compassion when in distress
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">[§ 3. <em>Of the Effect of Dearness of Provisions upon
Working, and upon Manufactures.</em>]</p>

<p>The common people do not work for pleasure generally,
but from necessity. Cheapness of provisions
makes them more idle; less work is then done, it is
then more in demand proportionally, and of course the
price rises. Dearness of provisions obliges the manufacturer
to work more days and more hours; thus more
work is done than equals the usual demand; of course
it becomes cheaper, and the manufactures in consequence.</p>

<p class="center">[§ 4. <em>Of an open Trade.</em>]</p>

<p>Perhaps, in general, it would be better if government
meddled no farther with trade, than to protect it, and
let it take its course. Most of the statutes or acts,
edicts, arrets, and placarts of parliaments, princes, and
states, for regulating, directing, or restraining of trade,
have, we think, been either political blunders, or jobs
obtained by artful men, for private advantage, under
pretence of public good. When Colbert assembled
some wise old merchants of France, and desired their
advice and opinion, how he could serve and promote
commerce: their answer, after consultation, was in
three words only, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laissez nous faire</i>; "Let us alone."&mdash;It
is said, by a very solid writer of the same nation,
that he is well advanced in the science of politics, who
knows the full force of that maxim, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas trop gouverner</i>,
"Not to govern too much;" which, perhaps, would be
of more use when applied to trade, than in any other
public concern. It were therefore to be wished, that
commerce were as free between all the nations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
world, as it is between the several counties of England;
so would all, by mutual communication, obtain more
enjoyments. Those counties do not ruin each other by
trade, neither would the nations. No nation was ever
ruined by trade, even, seemingly, the most disadvantageous.</p>

<p>Wherever desirable superfluities are imported, industry
is excited, and thereby plenty is produced. Were
only necessaries permitted to be purchased, men would
work no more than was necessary for that purpose.</p>

<p class="center">[§ 5. <em>Of Prohibitions, with Respect to the Exportation
of Gold and Silver.</em>]</p>

<p>Could Spain and Portugal have succeeded in executing
their foolish laws for <em>hedging in the cuckoo</em>, as Locke
calls it, and have kept at home all their gold and silver,
those metals would by this time have been of little
more value than so much lead or iron. Their plenty
would have lessened their value. We see the folly of
these edicts: but are not our own prohibitory and restrictive
laws, that are professedly made with intention
to bring a balance in our favour from our trade with
foreign nations to be paid in money, and laws to prevent
the necessity of exporting that money, which if
they could be thoroughly executed, would make money
as plenty, and of as little value; I say, are not such laws
a kin to those Spanish edicts, follies of the same family?</p>

<p class="center">[§ 6. <em>Of the Returns for foreign Articles.</em>]</p>

<p>In fact, the <em>produce of other countries</em> can hardly be
obtained, unless by fraud and rapine, without giving
the <em>produce of our land or our industry</em> in exchange for
them. If we have mines of gold and silver, gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
silver may then be called the produce of our land: if
we have not, we can only fairly obtain those metals by
giving for them the produce of our land or industry.
When we have them, they are then only that produce
or industry in another shape; which we may give, if
the trade requires it, and our other produce will not
suit, in exchange for the produce of some other country,
that furnishes what we have more occasion for, or
more desire. When we have, to an inconvenient degree,
parted with our gold and silver, our industry is
stimulated afresh to procure more; that, by its means,
we may contrive to procure the same advantage.</p>

<p class="center">[§ 7. <em>Of Restraints upon Commerce in Time of War.</em>]</p>

<p>When princes make war by prohibiting commerce,
each may hurt himself as much as his enemy. Traders,
who by their business are promoting the common good
of mankind, as well as farmers and fishermen, who labour
for the subsistence of all, should never be interrupted,
or molested in their business, but enjoy the protection
of all in the time of war, as well as in time of peace.</p>

<p>This policy, those, whom we are pleased to call Barbarians,
have in a great measure adopted; for the trading subjects
of any power with whom the emperor of Morocco
may be at war, are not liable to capture, when within
sight of his land, going or coming; and have otherwise
free liberty to trade and reside in his dominions.</p>

<p>As a maritime power, we presume it is not thought
right, that Great Britain should grant such freedom,
except partially; as in the case of war with France,
when tobacco is allowed to be sent thither under the
sanction of passports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">[§ 8. <em>Exchanges in Trade may be gainful to each Party.</em>]</p>

<p>In transactions of trade, it is not to be supposed,
that, like gaming, what one party <em>gains</em> the other must
necessarily <em>lose</em>. The gain to each may be equal. If A
has more corn than he can consume, but wants cattle;
and B has more cattle, but wants corn, exchange is gain
to each: hereby the common stock of comforts in life
is increased.</p>

<p class="center">[§9. <em>Of Paper Credit.</em>]</p>

<p>It is impossible for government to circumscribe, or
fix the extent of paper credit, which must of course
fluctuate. Government may as well pretend to lay
down rules for the operations, or the confidence of
every individual in the course of his trade. Any seeming
temporary evil arising, must naturally work its own
cure.</p>

<p class="pfs70 lsp2">TO MESSIEURS THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p>I am one of that class of people, that feeds you all,
and at present is abused by you all;&mdash;in short, I am a
<em>farmer</em>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>
<p>By your news-papers we are told, that God had sent
a very short harvest to some other countries of Europe.
I thought this might be in favour of Old England; and
that now we should get a good price for our grain,
which would bring millions among us, and make us flow
in money: that to be sure is scarce enough.</p>

<p>But the wisdom of government forbad the exportation<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>Well, says I, then we must be content with the market-price
at home.</p>

<p>No, say my lords the mob, you sha'n't have that.
Bring your corn to market if your dare;&mdash;we'll sell it
for you, for less money, or take it for nothing.</p>

<p>Being thus attacked by both ends <em>of the constitution</em>,
the head and tail <em>of government</em>, what am I to do?</p>

<p>Must I keep my corn in the barn, to feed and increase</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>
<p>the breed of rats?&mdash;be it so;&mdash;they cannot be less
thankful than those I have been used to feed.</p>

<p>Are we farmers the only people to be grudged the
profits of our honest labour?&mdash;And why? One of the
late scribblers against us gives a bill of fare of the provisions
at my daughter's wedding, and proclaims to all
the world, that we had the insolence to eat beef and
pudding!&mdash;Has he not read the precept in the good
book, <em>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that
treadeth out the corn</em>; or does he think us less worthy
of good living than our oxen?</p>

<p>O, but the manufacturers! the manufacturers! they
are to be favoured, and they must have bread at a
cheap rate!</p>

<p>Hark ye, Mr. Oaf:&mdash;The farmers live splendidly,
you say. And pray, would you have them hoard
the money they get? Their fine clothes and furniture,
do they make them themselves or for one another, and
so keep the money among them? Or, do they employ
these your darling manufacturers, and so scatter it again
all over the nation?</p>

<p>The wool would produce me a better price, if it were
suffered to go to foreign markets; but that, Messieurs
the Public, your laws will not permit. It must be kept
all at home, that our <em>dear</em> manufacturers may have it
the cheaper. And then, having yourselves thus lessened
our encouragement for raising sheep, you curse us for
the scarcity of mutton!</p>

<p>I have heard my grandfather say, that the farmers
submitted to the prohibition on the exportation of
wool, being made to expect and believe, that when the
manufacturer bought his wool cheaper, they should also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
have their cloth cheaper. But the deuce a bit. It has
been growing dearer and dearer from that day to this.
How so? Why, truly, the cloth is exported; and that
keeps up the price.</p>

<p>Now if it be a good principle, that the exportation of
a commodity is to be restrained, that so our people at
home may have it the cheaper; stick to that principle,
and go thorough stitch with it. Prohibit the exportation
of your cloth, your leather, and shoes, your ironware,
and your manufactures of all sorts, to make them,
all cheaper at home. And cheap enough they will be,
I will warrant you&mdash;till people leave off making them.</p>

<p>Some folks seem to think they ought never to be
easy till England becomes another Lubberland, where
it is fancied the streets are paved with penny-rolls, the
houses tiled with pancakes, and chickens, ready roasted,
cry, Come eat me.</p>

<p>I say, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'when you'">when you</ins> are sure you have got a good principle,
stick to it, and carry it thorough.&mdash;I hear it is said,
that though it was <em>necessary and right</em> for the m&mdash;&mdash;y
to advise a prohibition of the exportation of corn, yet
it was <em>contrary to law</em>; and also, that though it was <em>contrary
to law</em> for the mob to obstruct waggons, yet it was
<em>necessary and right</em>.&mdash;Just the same thing to a tittle.
Now they tell me, an act of indemnity ought to pass in
favour of the m&mdash;&mdash;y, to secure them from the consequences
of having acted illegally.&mdash;If so, pass another
in favour of the mob. Others say, some of the mob
ought to be hanged, by way of example.&mdash;-If so,&mdash;but
I say no more than I have said before, <em>when you
are sure that you have got a good principle, go through
with it</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>You say, poor labourers cannot afford to buy bread
at a high price, unless they had higher wages.&mdash;Possibly.&mdash;But
how shall we farmers be able to afford our
labourers higher wages, if you will not allow us to
get, when we might have it, a higher price for our
corn?</p>

<p>By all that I can learn, we should at least have had a
guinea a quarter more, if the exportation had been
allowed. And this money England would have got
from foreigners.</p>

<p>But, it seems, we farmers must take so much less,
that the poor may have it so much cheaper.</p>

<p>This operates then as a tax for the maintenance of
the poor. A very good thing, you will say. But I
ask, why a partial tax? why laid on us farmers only?
If it be a good thing, pray, Messieurs the Public, take
your share of it, by indemnifying us a little out of your
public treasury. In doing a good thing, there is both
honour and pleasure&mdash;you are welcome to your share
of both.</p>

<p>For my own part, I am not so well satisfied of the
goodness of this thing. I am for doing good to the
poor, but I differ in opinion about the means. I think
the best way of doing good to the poor, is, not making
them easy <em>in</em> poverty, but leading or driving them <em>out</em>
of it. In my youth I travelled much, and I observed
in different countries, that the more public provisions
were made for the poor, the less they provided for
themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on
the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they
did for themselves, and became richer. There is no
country in the world where so many provisions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
established for them; so many hospitals to receive them
when they are sick or lame, founded and maintained by
voluntary charities; so many alms houses for the aged
of both sexes, together with a solemn general law made
by the rich to subject their estates to a heavy tax for
the support of the poor. Under all these obligations,
are our poor modest, humble, and thankful? And do
they use their best endeavours to maintain themselves,
and lighten our shoulders of this burthen? On the
contrary, I affirm, that there is no country in the world
in which the poor are more idle, dissolute, drunken,
and insolent. The day you passed that act, you took
away from before their eyes the greatest of all inducements
to industry, frugality, and sobriety, by giving
them a dependence on somewhat else than a careful
accumulation during youth and health, for support in
age or sickness. In short, you offered a premium for
the encouragement of idleness, and you should not
now wonder, that it has had its effect in the increase of
poverty. Repeal that law, and you will soon see a
change in their manners, <em>Saint Monday</em>, and <em>Saint
Tuesday</em>, will soon cease to be holidays. Six <em>days shalt
thou labour</em>, though one of the old commandments long
treated as out of date, will again be looked upon as a
respectable precept; industry will increase, and with it
plenty among the lower people; their circumstances
will mend, and more will be done for their happiness
by inuring them to provide for themselves, than could
be done by dividing all your estates among them.</p>

<p>Excuse me, Messieurs the Public, if upon this <em>interesting</em>
subject, I put you to the trouble of reading a
little of <em>my</em> nonsense; I am sure I have lately read a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>"There is now publishing in France a periodical work, called Ephemeridis
du Citoyen, in which several points, interesting to those concerned
in agriculture, are from time to time discussed by some able hands. In
looking over one of the volumes of this work a few days ago, I found a
little piece written by one of our countrymen, and which our vigilant

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On Luxury, Idleness, and Industry.</em></a></h3>

<p class="pfs80">Written in 1784.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how preposterously the affairs of this
world are managed. Naturally one would imagine,
that the interest of a few individuals should give way
to general interest; but individuals manage their affairs
with so much more application, industry, and address,
than the public do theirs, that, general interest most
commonly gives way to particular. We assemble parliaments
and councils, to have the benefit of their collected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>wisdom; but we necessarily have, at the same
time, the inconvenience of their collected passions,
prejudices, and private interests. By the help of these,
artful men overpower their wisdom, and dupe its possessors:
and if we may judge, by the acts, arrets, and
edicts, all the world over, for regulating commerce,
an assembly of great men is the greatest fool upon
earth.</p>

<p>I have not yet, indeed, thought of a remedy for
luxury. I am not sure that in a great state it is capable
of a remedy, nor that the evil is in itself always so great
as it is represented. Suppose we include in the definition
of luxury all unnecessary expence, and then let us
consider, whether laws to prevent such expence are
possible to be executed in a great country, and whether,
if they could be executed, our people generally
would be happier, or even richer. Is not the hope of
being one day able to purchase and enjoy luxuries, a
great spur to labour and industry? May not luxury
therefore produce more than it consumes, if, without
such a spur, people would be, as they are naturally
enough inclined to be, lazy and indolent? To this purpose
I remember a circumstance. The skipper of a
shallop, employed between Cape-May and Philadelphia,
had done us some small service, for which he
refused to be paid. My wife, understanding that he
had a daughter, sent her a present of a new-fashioned
cap. Three years after, this skipper being at my house
with an old farmer of Cape-May, his passenger, he
mentioned the cap, and how much his daughter had
been pleased with it. "But (said he) it proved a dear
cap to our congregation." "How so?" "When my
daughter appeared with it at meeting, it was so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
admired, that all the girls resolved to get such caps
from Philadelphia; and my wife and I computed, that
the whole could not have cost less than a hundred
pounds." "True (said the farmer), but you do not tell
all the story. I think the cap was nevertheless an advantage
to us, for it was the first thing that put our
girls upon knitting worsted mittens for sale at Philadelphia,
that they might have wherewithal to buy caps
and ribbons there, and you know that that industry has
continued, and is likely to continue and increase to a
much greater value, and answer better purposes."&mdash;Upon
the whole, I was more reconciled to this little
piece of luxury, since not only the girls were made
happier by having fine caps, but the Philadelphians by
the supply of warm mittens.</p>

<p>In our commercial towns upon the sea-coast, fortunes
will occasionally be made. Some of those who
grow rich will be prudent, live within bounds, and
preserve what they have gained for their posterity:
others, fond of showing their wealth, will be extravagant,
and ruin themselves. Laws cannot prevent this:
and perhaps it is not always an evil to the public. A
shilling spent idly by a fool, may be picked up by a
wiser person, who knows better what to do with it. It
is therefore not lost. A vain silly fellow builds a fine
house, furnishes it richly, lives in it expensively, and in
a few years ruins himself: but the masons, carpenters,
smiths, and other honest tradesmen, have been by his
employ assisted in maintaining and raising their families;
the farmer has been paid for his labour, and encouraged,
and the estate is now in better hands. In
some cases, indeed, certain modes of luxury may be a
public evil, in the same manner as it is a private one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
If there be a nation, for instance, that exports its beef
and linen, to pay for the importation of claret and porter,
while a great part of its people live upon potatoes,
and wear no shirts, wherein does it differ from the sot,
who lets his family starve, and sells his clothes to buy
drink? Our American commerce is, I confess, a little in
this way. We sell our victuals to the islands for rum
and sugar; the substantial necessaries of life for superfluities.
But we have plenty, and live well nevertheless,
though, by being soberer, we might be richer.</p>

<p>The vast quantity of forest land we have yet to clear,
and put in order for cultivation, will for a long time
keep the body of our nation laborious and frugal.
Forming an opinion of our people and their manners,
by what is seen among the inhabitants of the sea-ports,
is judging from an improper sample. The people of
the trading towns may be rich and luxurious, while the
country possesses all the virtues, that tend to promote
happiness and public prosperity. Those towns are not
much regarded by the country; they are hardly considered
as an essential part of the states, and the experience
of the last war has shown, that their being in the
possession of the enemy did not necessarily draw on
the subjection of the country, which bravely continued
to maintain its freedom and independence notwithstanding.</p>

<p>It has been computed by some political arithmetician,
that if every man and woman would work for four
hours each day on something useful, that labour would
produce sufficient to procure all the necessaries and
comforts of life, want and misery would be banished
out of the world, and the rest of the twenty-four hours
might be leisure and pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>What occasions then so much want and misery? It
is the employment of men and women in works, that
produce neither the necessaries nor conveniences of
life, who, with those who do nothing, consume necessaries
raised by the laborious. To explain this.</p>

<p>The first elements of wealth are obtained by labour,
from the earth and waters. I have land, and raise
corn. With this, if I feed a family that does nothing,
my corn will be consumed, and at the end of the year
I shall be no richer than I was at the beginning. But
if, while I feed them, I employ them, some in spinning,
others in making bricks, &amp;c. for building, the
value of my corn will be arrested and remain with me,
and at the end of the year we may all be better clothed
and better lodged. And if, instead of employing a
man I feed in making bricks, I employ him in fiddling
for me, the corn he eats is gone, and no part of his
manufacture remains to augment the wealth and convenience
of the family: I shall therefore be the poorer
for this fiddling man, unless the rest of my family
work more, or eat less, to make up the deficiency he
occasions.</p>

<p>Look round the world, and see the millions employed
in doing nothing, or in something that amounts to nothing,
when the necessaries and conveniences of life
are in question. What is the bulk of commerce, for
which we fight and destroy each other, but the toil of
millions for superfluities, to the great hazard and loss
of many lives, by the constant dangers of the sea?
How much labour is spent in building and fitting great
ships, to go to China and Arabia for tea and coffee, to
the West Indies for sugar, to America for tobacco?
These things cannot be called the necessaries of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
for our ancestors lived very comfortably without
them.</p>

<p>A question may be asked: could all these people
now employed in raising, making, or carrying superfluities,
be subsisted by raising necessaries? I think
they might. The world is large, and a great part of it
still uncultivated. Many hundred millions of acres in
Asia, Africa, and America, are still in a forest, and a
great deal even in Europe. On a hundred acres of this
forest a man might become a substantial farmer, and a
hundred thousand men, employed in clearing each his
hundred acres, would hardly brighten a spot big
enough to be visible from the moon, unless with Herschel's
telescope; so vast are the regions still in wood.</p>

<p>It is, however, some comfort to reflect, that, upon the
whole, the quantity of industry and prudence among
mankind exceeds the quantity of idleness and folly.
Hence the increase of good buildings, farms cultivated,
and populous cities filled with wealth, all over Europe,
which a few ages since were only to be found on the
coasts of the Mediterranean; and this notwithstanding
the mad wars continually raging, by which are often
destroyed in one year the works of many years peace.
So that we may hope the luxury of a few merchants on
the coast will not be the ruin of America.</p>

<p>One reflection more, and I will end this long rambling
letter. Almost all the parts of our bodies require some
expence. The feet demand shoes; the legs stockings;
the rest of the body clothing; and the belly a good deal
of victuals. Our eyes, though exceedingly useful, ask,
when reasonable, only the cheap assistance of spectacles,
which could not much impair our finances. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the eyes of other people are the eyes that ruin us. If
all but myself were blind, I should want neither fine
clothes, fine houses, nor fine furniture.</p>

<p class="fs60 pad2">SIR,</p>

<p>There are many people that would be thought,
and even think themselves, <em>honest</em> men, who fail nevertheless
in particular points of honesty; deviating from
that character sometimes by the prevalence of mode or
custom, and sometimes through mere inattention; so
that their <em>honesty</em> is partial only, and not <em>general</em> or universal.
Thus one, who would scorn to over-reach you
in a bargain, shall make no scruple of tricking you a little
now and then at cards; another, that plays with the
utmost fairness, shall with great freedom cheat you in
the sale of a horse. But there is no kind of dishonesty,
into which otherwise good people more easily and frequently
fall, than that of defrauding government of its
revenues by smuggling, when they have an opportunity,
or encouraging smugglers by buying their goods.</p>

<p>I fell into these reflections the other day, on hearing
two gentlemen of reputation discoursing about a small
estate, which one of them was inclined to sell, and the
other to buy; when the seller, in recommending the
place, remarked, that its situation was very advantageous
on this account, that, being on the sea-coast in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
smuggling country, one had frequent opportunities of
buying many of the expensive articles used in a family
(such as tea, coffee, chocolate, brandy, wines, cambrics,
Brussels laces, French silks, and all kinds of India
goods), 20, 30, and in some articles 50 <em>per cent</em> cheaper,
than they could be had in the more interior parts, of
traders that paid duty.&mdash;The other <em>honest</em> gentlemen
allowed this to be an advantage, but insisted, that the
seller, in the advanced price he demanded on that account,
rated the advantage much above its value. And
neither of them seemed to think dealing with smugglers
a practice, that an <em>honest</em> man (provided he got his
goods cheap) had the least reason to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>At a time when the load of our, public debt, and the
heavy expence of maintaining our fleets and armies to
be ready for our defence on occasion, makes it necessary,
not only to continue old taxes, but often to look
out for new ones, perhaps it may not be unuseful to
state this matter in a light, that few seem to have considered
it in.</p>

<p>The people of Great Britain, under the happy constitution
of this country, have a privilege few other countries
enjoy, that of choosing the third branch of the
legislature, which branch has alone the power of regulating
their taxes. Now whenever the government
finds it necessary for the common benefit, advantage,
and safety of the nation, for the security of our liberties,
property, religion, and every thing that is dear to
us, that certain sums shall be yearly raised by taxes,
duties, &amp;c. and paid into the public treasury, thence to
be dispensed by government for those purposes; ought
not every <em>honest man</em> freely and willingly to pay his just
proportion of this necessary expence? Can he possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
preserve a right to that character, if, by any fraud, stratagem,
or contrivance, he avoids that payment in whole
or in part.</p>

<p>What should we think of a companion, who, having
supped with his friends at a tavern, and partaken equally
of the joys of the evening with the rest of us, would
nevertheless contrive by some artifice to shift his share
of the reckoning upon others, in order to go off scot-free?
If a man who practised this would, when detected,
be deemed and called a scoundrel, what ought he
to be called, who can enjoy all the inestimable benefits
of public society, and yet by smuggling, or dealing with
smugglers, contrive to evade paying his just share of
the expence, as settled by his own representatives
in parliament; and wrongfully throw it upon his honester
and perhaps much poorer neighbours? He will
perhaps be ready to tell me, that he does not wrong his
neighbours; he scorns the imputation, he only cheats
the king a little, who is very able to bear it. This however
is a mistake. The public treasure is the treasure
of the nation, to be applied to national purposes. And
when a duty is laid for a particular public and necessary
purpose, if, through smuggling, that duty falls short of
raising the sum required, and other duties must therefore
be laid to make up the deficiency, all the additional
sum laid by the new duties and paid by other people,
though it should amount to no more than a halfpenny
or a farthing per head, is so much actually picked
out of the pockets of those other people by the
smugglers and their abettors and encouragers. Are
they then any better or other than pickpockets? and
what mean, low, rascally pickpockets must those be,
that can pick pockets for halfpence and for farthings?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>I would not however be supposed to allow in what I
have just said, that cheating the king is a less offence
against honesty, than cheating the public. The king
and the public in this case are different names for the
same thing; but if we consider the king distinctly it
will not lessen the crime: it is no justification of a robbery,
that the person robbed was rich and able to bear
it. The king has as much right to justice as the meanest
of his subjects; and as he is truly the common
<em>father</em> of his people, those that rob him fall under the
scripture woe, pronounced against the son <em>that robbeth
his father, and saith it is no sin</em>.</p>

<p>Mean as this practice is, do we not daily see people
of character and fortune engaged in it for trifling advantages
to themselves?&mdash;Is any lady ashamed to request
of a gentleman of her acquaintance, that when
he returns from abroad, he would smuggle her home a
piece of silk or lace from France or Flanders? Is any
gentleman ashamed to undertake and execute the commission?&mdash;Not
in the least. They will talk of it freely,
even before others whose pockets they are thus contriving
to pick by this piece of knavery.</p>

<p>Among other branches of the revenue, that of the
post-office is, by a late law, appropriated to the discharge
of our public debt, to defray the expences of
the state. None but members of parliament, and a few
public officers have now a right to avoid, by a frank,
the payment of postage. When any letter, not written
by them or on their business, is franked by any of
them, it is a hurt to the revenue, an injury which they
must now take the pains to conceal by writing the
whole superscription themselves. And yet such is our
insensibility to justice in this particular, that nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
more common than to see, even in a reputable company,
a <em>very honest</em> gentleman or lady declare his or her
intention to cheat the nation of three-pence by a frank,
and without blushing apply to one of the very legislators
themselves, with a modest request, that he would
be pleased to become an accomplice in the crime, and
assist in the perpetration.</p>

<p>There are those who by these practices take a great
deal in a year out of the public purse, and put the
money into their own private pockets. If, passing
through a room where public treasure is deposited, a
man takes the opportunity of clandestinely pocketing
and carrying off a guinea, is he not truly and properly
a thief? And if another evades paying into the treasury
a guinea he ought to pay in, and applies it to his own
use, when he knows it belongs to the public as much as
that which has been paid in, what difference is there in
the nature of the crime, or the baseness of committing
it?</p>

<p>Some laws make the receiving of stolen goods equally
penal with stealing, and upon this principle, that if
there were no receivers there would be few thieves.
Our proverb too says truly, that <em>the receiver is as bad as
the thief</em>. By the same reasoning, as there would be
few smugglers, if there were none who knowingly encouraged
them by buying their goods, we may say, that
the encouragers of smuggling are as bad as the smugglers;
and that, as smugglers are a kind of thieves, both
equally deserve the punishments of thievery.</p>

<p>In this view of wronging the revenue, what must we
think of those who can evade paying for their wheels
and their plate, in defiance of law and justice, and yet
declaim against corruption and peculation, as if their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
own hands and hearts were pure and unsullied? The
Americans offend us grievously, when, contrary to our
laws, they smuggle goods into their own country: and
yet they had no hand in making those laws. I do not
however pretend from thence to justify them. But I
think the offence much greater in those who either
directly or indirectly have been concerned in making
the very laws they break. And when I hear them exclaiming
against the Americans, and for every little
infringement of the acts of trade, or obstruction given
by a petty mob to an officer of our customs in that
country, calling for vengeance against the whole people
as <span class="smcap">rebels</span> and traitors, I cannot help thinking there
are still those in the world who can <em>see a mote in their
brother's eye, while they do not discern a beam in their
own</em>; and that the old saying is as true now as ever it
was, <em>one man may better steal a horse, than another look
over the hedge</em>.</p>

<p>By the original law of nations, war and extirpation
were the punishment of injury. Humanizing by degrees,
it admitted slavery instead of death: a farther
step was the exchange of prisoners instead of slavery:
another, to respect more the property of private persons
under conquest, and be content with acquired dominion.
Why should not this law of nations go on improving?
Ages have intervened between its several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
steps: but as knowledge of late increases rapidly, why
should not those steps be quickened? Why should it
not be agreed to, as the future law of nations, that in
any war hereafter the following description of men
should be undisturbed, have the protection of both
sides, and be permitted to follow their employments in
security? viz.</p>

<p>1. Cultivators of the earth, because they labour for
the subsistence of mankind.</p>

<p>2. Fishermen, for the same reason.</p>

<p>3. Merchants and traders in unarmed ships, who
accommodate different nations by communicating and
exchanging the necessaries and conveniences of life.</p>

<p>4. Artists and mechanics, inhabiting and working in
open towns.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add, that the hospitals of
enemies should be unmolested&mdash;they ought to be assisted.
It is for the interest of humanity in general, that
the occasions of war, and the inducements to it, should
be diminished. If rapine be abolished, one of the encouragements
to war is taken away; and peace therefore
more likely to continue and be lasting.</p>

<p>The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas&mdash;a
remnant of the antient piracy&mdash;though it may be
accidentally beneficial to particular persons, is far from
being profitable to all engaged in it, or to the nation
that authorises it. In the beginning of a war, some
rich ships are surprized and taken. This encourages
the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels, and
many others to do the same. But the enemy at the
same time become more careful, arm their merchant
ships better, and render them not so easy to be taken:
they go also more under the protection of convoys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Thus, while the privateers to take them are multiplied,
the vessels subject to be taken, and the chances of
profit, are diminished; so that many cruises are made
wherein the expences overgo the gains, and, as is the
case in other lotteries, though particulars have got
prizes, the mass of adventurers are losers, the whole
expence of fitting out all the privateers during a war
being much greater than the whole amount of goods
taken.</p>

<p>Then there is the national loss of all the labour of so
many men during the time they have been employed
in robbing, who besides spend what they get in riot,
drunkenness, and debauchery, lose their habits of industry,
are rarely fit for any sober business after a
peace, and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen
and housebreakers. Even the undertakers,
who have been fortunate, are by sudden wealth led into
expensive living, the habit of which continues when the
means of supporting it cease, and finally ruins them: a
just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly
ruined many honest, innocent traders and their
families, whose substance was employed in serving the
common interest of mankind.</p>

to seamen, and inconvenience to trade. Inconvenience
to the whole trade of a nation will not justify injustice
to a single seaman. If the trade would suffer without
his service, it is able and ought to be willing to offer him
such wages, as may induce him to afford his service
voluntarily.</p>

<p>Page 159. "Private mischief must be borne with
patience, for preventing a national calamity."&mdash;Where
is this maxim in law and good policy to be found? And
how can that be a maxim, which is not consistent with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
common sense? If the maxim had been, that private
mischiefs, which prevent a national calamity, ought to
be generously compensated by the nation, one might
understand it: but that such private mischiefs are only
to be borne with patience, is absurd!</p>

<p><em>Ib.</em> "The expedient, &amp;c. And, &amp;c." (Paragraphs 2
and 3).&mdash;Twenty ineffectual or inconvenient schemes
will not justify one that is unjust.</p>

<p><em>Ib.</em> "Upon the foot of, &amp;c."&mdash;Your reasoning, indeed,
like a lie, stands but upon one <em>foot</em>, truth upon
two.</p>

<p>Page 160. "Full wages."&mdash;Probably the same they
had in the merchant's service.</p>

<p>Page 174. "I hardly admit, &amp;c." (Paragraph 5).&mdash;When
this author speaks of impressing, page 158, he
diminishes the horror of the practice as much as possible,
by presenting to the mind one sailor only suffering
a "<em>hardship</em>" (as he tenderly calls it) in some "<em>particular
cases</em>" only, and he places against this private
mischief the inconvenience to the trade of the kingdom.&mdash;But
if, as he supposes is often the case, the sailor
who is pressed, and obliged to serve for the defence
of trade, at the rate of twenty-five shillings a month,
could get three pounds fifteen shillings in the merchant's
service, you take from him fifty shillings a
month; and if you have a 100,000 in your service, you
rob this honest industrious part of society and their
poor families of 250,000<i>l.</i> per month, or three millions
a year, and at the same time oblige them to hazard their
lives in fighting for the defence of your trade, to the
defence of which all ought indeed to contribute (and
sailors among the rest) in proportion to their profits by
it: but this three millions is more than their share, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
they did not pay with their persons; but when you
force that, methinks you should excuse the other.</p>

<p>But it may be said, to give the king's seamen merchant's
wages would cost the nation too much, and call
for more taxes. The question then will amount to
this: whether it be just in a community, that the richer
part should compel the poorer to fight in defence of
them and their properties, for such wages as they think
fit to allow, and punish them if they refuse? Our
author tells us that it is "<em>legal</em>." I have not law
enough to dispute his authorities, but I cannot persuade
myself that it is equitable. I will, however,
own for the present, that it may be lawful when necessary;
but then I contend, that it may be used so as to
produce the same good effects, <em>the public security</em>, without
doing so much intolerable injustice as attends the
impressing common seamen.&mdash;In order to be better
understood I would premise two things: first, that
voluntary seamen may be had for the service, if they
were sufficiently paid. The proof is, that to serve in
the same ship, and incur the same dangers, you have
no occasion to impress captains, lieutenants, second
lieutenants, midshipmen, pursers, nor many other officers.
Why, but that the profits of their places, or the
emoluments expected, are sufficient inducements? The
business then is, to find money, by impressing, sufficient
to make the sailors all volunteers, as well as their
officers, and this without any fresh burthen upon trade.&mdash;The
second of my premises is, that twenty-five shillings
a month, with his share of the salt beef, pork, and
peas-pudding, being found sufficient for the subsistence
of a hard-working seaman, it will certainly be so for a
sedentary scholar or gentleman. I would then propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
to form a treasury, out of which encouragements to
seamen should be paid. To fill this treasury, I would
impress a number of civil officers, who at present have
great salaries, oblige them to serve in their respective
offices for twenty-five shillings a month, with their shares
of mess provisions, and throw the rest of their salaries
into the seamen's treasury. If such a press-warrant
were given me to execute, the first I would press should
be a recorder of Bristol, or a Mr. Justice Foster, because
I might have need of his edifying example, to
show how much impressing ought to be borne with;
for he would certainly find, that though to be reduced
to twenty-five shillings a month might be a "<em>private
mischief</em>," yet that, agreeably to his maxim of law and
good policy, it "<em>ought to be borne with patience</em>," for
preventing a national calamity. Then I would press
the rest of the judges; and, opening the red book, I
would press every civil officer of government from 50<i>l.</i>
a year salary, up to 50,000<i>l.</i> which would throw an immense
sum into our treasury: and these gentlemen
could not complain, since they would receive twenty-five
shillings a month, and their rations; and this without
being obliged to fight. Lastly, I think I would
impress ****</p>

<h3><a href="#CONTENTS"><em>On the criminal Laws, and the Practice of Privateering.</em></a></h3>

<p class="right padr2"><em>March 14, 1785.</em></p>

<p class="smcap pad2">My dear Friend,</p>

<p>Among the pamphlets you lately sent me, was
one, entitled, Thoughts on Executive Justice. In return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
for that, I send you a French one on the same
subject, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Observations concernant l'Exécution de l'Article
II, de la Déclaration sur le Vol.</span> They are both
addressed to the judges, but written, as you will see, in
a very different spirit. The English author is for hanging
<em>all</em> thieves. The Frenchman is for proportioning
punishments to offences.</p>

<p>If we really believe, as we profess to believe, that the
law of Moses was the law of God, the dictate of divine
wisdom, infinitely superior to human; on what principles
do we ordain death as the punishment of an offence,
which, according to that law, was only to be punished
by a restitution of fourfold? To put a man to death for
an offence, which does not deserve death, is it not a
murder? And, as the French writer says, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Doit on punir
un délit contre la societé, par un crime contre la nature?</i></p>

<p>Superfluous property is the creature of society. Simple
and mild laws were sufficient to guard the property
that was merely necessary. The savage's bow, his
hatchet, and his coat of skins, were sufficiently secured,
without law, by the fear of personal resentment and retaliation.
When, by virtue of the first laws, part of
the society accumulated wealth and grew powerful, they
enacted others more severe, and would protect their
property at the expence of humanity. This was abusing
their power, and commencing a tyranny. If a savage,
before he entered into society, had been told,&mdash;"Your
neighbour, by this means, may become owner
of an hundred deer; but if your brother, or your son,
or yourself, having no deer of your own, and being
hungry, should kill one, an infamous death must be the
consequence:" he would probably have preferred his
liberty, and his common right of killing any deer, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
all the advantages of society that might be proposed
to him.</p>

<p>That it is better a hundred guilty persons should
escape, than that one innocent person should suffer, is
a maxim that has been long and generally approved;
never, that I know of, controverted. Even the sanguinary
author of the Thoughts agrees to it, adding well,
"that the very thought of <em>injured</em> innocence, and much
more that of <em>suffering</em> innocence, must awaken all our
tenderest and most compassionate feelings, and at the
same time raise our highest indignation against the instruments
of it." "But," he adds, "there is no danger
of <em>either</em>, from a strict adherence to the laws."&mdash;Really!
Is it then impossible to make an unjust law? and if the
law itself be unjust, may it not be the very "instrument"
which ought "to raise the author's, and every
body's highest indignation?" I see, in the last newspapers
from London, that a woman is capitally convicted
at the Old Bailey, for privately stealing out of a shop
some gauze, value fourteen shillings and three-pence:
is there any proportion between the injury done
by a theft, value fourteen shillings and three-pence,
and the punishment of a human creature, by death, on
a gibbet? Might not that woman, by her labour, have
made the reparation ordained by God, in paying fourfold?
Is not all punishment, inflicted beyond the merit
of the offence, so much punishment of innocence? In
this light, how vast is the annual quantity, of not only
<em>injured</em> but <em>suffering</em> innocence, in almost all the civilized
states of Europe!</p>

<p>But it seems to have been thought, that this kind of
innocence may be punished by way of <em>preventing</em> crimes.
I have read, indeed, of a cruel Turk in Barbary, who,
whenever he bought a new Christian slave, ordered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
immediately to be hung up by the legs, and to receive
a hundred blows of a cudgel on the soles of his feet,
that the severe sense of the punishment, and fear of
incurring it thereafter, might prevent the faults, that
should merit it. Our author himself would hardly approve
entirely of this Turk's conduct in the government
of slaves; and yet he appears to recommend something
like it for the government of English subjects, when he
applauds the reply of judge Burnet to the convict
horse-stealer; who, being asked what he had to say why
judgment of death should not pass against him, and answering,
that it was hard to hang a man for <em>only</em> stealing
a horse, was told by the judge, "Man, thou art not
to be hanged <em>only</em> for stealing a horse, but that horses
may not be stolen." The man's answer, if candidly examined,
will, I imagine, appear reasonable, as being
founded on the eternal principle of justice and equity,
that punishments should be proportioned to offences;
and the judge's reply brutal and unreasonable, though
the writer "wishes all judges to carry it with them
whenever they go the circuit, and to bear it in their
minds, as containing a wise reason for all the penal
statutes, which they are called upon to put in execution.
"It at once illustrates," says he, "the true grounds and
reasons of all capital punishments whatsoever, namely,
that every man's property, as well as his life, may be
held sacred and inviolate." Is there then no difference
in value between property and life? If I think it right,
that the crime of murder should be punished with
death, not only as an equal punishment of the crime,
but to prevent other murders, does it follow, that I must
approve of inflicting the same punishment for a little
invasion on my property by theft? If I am not myself
so barbarous, so bloody-minded, and revengeful, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
kill a fellow-creature for stealing from me fourteen
shillings and three-pence, how can I approve of a law
that does it? Montesquieu, who was himself a judge,
endeavours to impress other maxims. He must have
known what humane judges feel on such occasions, and
what the effects of those feelings; and, so far from
thinking that severe and excessive punishments prevent
crimes, he asserts, as quoted by our French writer, that</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'atrocité des loix en empêche l'exécution.</i></p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'orsque la peine est sans mesure, on est souvent obligé
de lui préférer l'impunité.</i></p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La cause de tous les relâchemens vient de l'impunité
des crimes, et non de la modération des peines.</i>"</p>

<p>It is said by those who know Europe generally, that
there are more thefts committed and punished annually
in England, than in all the other nations put together.
If this be so, there must be a cause or causes for such
depravity in our common people. May not one be the
deficiency of justice and morality in our national government,
manifested in our oppressive conduct to subjects,
and unjust wars on our neighbours? View the
long-persisted in, unjust, monopolizing treatment of
Ireland, at length acknowledged! View the plundering
government exercised by our merchants in the Indies;
the confiscating war made upon the American colonies;
and, to say nothing of those upon France and Spain,
view the late war upon Holland, which was seen by impartial
Europe in no other light than that of a war of
rapine and pillage; the hopes of an immense and easy
prey being its only apparent, and probably its true and
real motive and encouragement. Justice is as strictly
due between neighbour nations, as between neighbour
citizens. A highwayman is as much a robber when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
plunders in a gang, as when single; and a nation, that
makes an unjust war, is only a great gang. After employing
your people in robbing the Dutch, strange is it,
that, being put out of that employ by peace, they still
continue robbing, and rob one another? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Piraterie</i>, as
the French call it, or privateering, is the universal bent
of the English nation, at home and abroad, wherever
settled. No less than seven hundred privateers were,
it is said, commissioned in the last war! These were
fitted out by merchants, to prey upon other merchants,
who had never done them any injury. Is there probably
any one of those privateering merchants of London,
who were so ready to rob the merchants of Amsterdam,
that would not as readily plunder another London merchant
of the next street, if he could do it with the same
impunity! The avidity, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alieni appetens</i>, is the same;
it is the fear alone of the gallows that makes the difference.
How then can a nation, which, among the honestest
of its people, has so many thieves by inclination,
and whose government encouraged and commissioned
no less than seven hundred gangs of robbers; how can
such a nation have the face to condemn the crime in
individuals, and hang up twenty of them in a morning!
It naturally puts one in mind of a Newgate anecdote.
One of the prisoners complained, that in the night
somebody had taken his buckles out of his shoes.
"What, the devil!" says another, "have we then <em>thieves</em>
amongst us? It must not be suffered. Let us search
out the rogue, and pump him to death."</p>

<p>There is, however, one late instance of an English
merchant, who will not profit by such ill-gotten gain.
He was, it seems, part-owner of a ship, which the other
owners thought fit to employ as a letter of marque, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
which took a number of French prizes. The booty
being shared, he has now an agent here enquiring, by
an advertisement in the Gazette, for those who suffered
the loss, in order to make them, as far as in him lies,
restitution. This conscientious man is a Quaker.
The Scotch presbyterians were formerly as tender;
for there is still extant an ordinance of the town-council
of Edinburgh, made soon after the reformation,
"forbidding the purchase of prize goods, under
pain of losing the freedom of the burgh for ever,
with other punishment at the will of the magistrate;
the practice of making prizes being contrary to good
conscience, and the rule of treating Christian brethren
as we would wish to be treated; and such goods <em>are
not to be sold by any godly men within this burgh</em>." The
race of these godly men in Scotland is probably extinct,
or their principles abandoned, since, as far as that
nation had a hand in promoting the war against the
colonies, prizes and confiscations are believed to have
been a considerable motive.</p>

<p>It has been for some time a generally received opinion,
that a military man is not to inquire whether a
war be just or unjust; he is to execute his orders. All
princes who are disposed to become tyrants must probably
approve of this opinion, and be willing to establish
it; but is it not a dangerous one? since, on that
principle, if the tyrant commands his army to attack
and destroy, not only an unoffending neighbour nation,
but even his own subjects, the army is bound to obey.
A negro slave, in our colonies, being commanded by
his master to rob or murder a neighbour, or do any
other immoral act, may refuse, and the magistrate will
protect him in his refusal. The slavery then of a soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
is worse than that of a negro! A conscientious officer,
if <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'not restained'">not restrained</ins> by the apprehension of its being
imputed to another cause, may indeed resign, rather
than be employed in an unjust war; but the private
men are slaves for life; and they are perhaps incapable
of judging for themselves. We can only lament their
fate, and still more that of a sailor, who is often dragged
by force from his honest occupation, and compelled to
imbrue his hands in, perhaps, innocent blood. But
methinks it well behoves merchants (men more enlightened
by their education, and perfectly free from any
such force or obligation) to consider well of the justice
of a war, before they voluntarily engage a gang of ruffians
to attack their fellow-merchants of a neighbouring
nation, to plunder them of their property, and perhaps
ruin them and their families, if they yield it; or to
wound, maim, or murder them, if they endeavour to
defend it. Yet these things are done by Christian merchants,
whether a war be just or unjust; and it can
hardly be just on both sides. They are done by English
and American merchants, who, nevertheless, complain
of private theft, and hang by dozens the thieves
they have taught by their own example.</p>

<p>It is high time, for the sake of humanity, that a stop
were put to this enormity. The United States of America,
though better situated than any European nation
to make profit by privateering (most of the trade of Europe,
with the West Indies, passing before their doors)
are, as far as in them lies, endeavouring to abolish the
practice, by offering, in all their treaties with other
powers, an article, engaging solemnly, that, in case of
future war, no privateer shall be commissioned on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
side; and that unarmed merchant-ships, on both sides,
shall pursue their voyages unmolested<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. This will be
a happy improvement of the law of nations. The humane
and the just cannot but wish general success to
the proposition.</p>

<p>1. And it came to pass after these things, that
Abraham sat in the door of his tent, about the going
down of the sun.</p>

<p>2. And behold a man bent with age, coming from the
way of the wilderness leaning on a staff.</p>

<p>3. And Abraham arose, and met him, and said unto
him, Turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry
all night; and thou shalt arise early in the morning,
and go on thy way.</p>

<p>4. And the man said, Nay; for I will abide under this
tree.</p>

<p>5. But Abraham pressed him greatly: so he turned
and they went into the tent: and Abraham baked unleaven
bread, and they did eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>6. And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not
God, he said unto him, Wherefore dost thou not worship
the most high God, creator of heaven and earth?</p>

<p>7. And the man answered and said, I do not worship
thy God, neither do I call upon his name, for I have
made to myself a god, which abideth always in my
house, and provideth me with all things.</p>

<p>8. And Abraham's zeal was kindled against the man,
and he arose, and fell upon him, and drove him forth
with blows into the wilderness.</p>

<p>9. And God called unto Abraham, saying, Abraham,
where is the stranger?</p>

<p>10. And Abraham answered and said, Lord, he would
not worship thee, neither would he call upon thy name,
therefore have I driven him out from before my face
into the wilderness.</p>

<p>11. And God said, Have I borne with him these hundred
and ninety and eight years, and nourished him,
and clothed him, notwithstanding his rebellion against
me, and couldst not thou, who art thyself a sinner, bear
with him one night?</p>

<p>12. And Abraham said, Let not the anger of my Lord
wax hot against his servant; lo, I have sinned, forgive
me I pray thee.</p>

<p>13. And Abraham arose, and went forth into the wilderness
and diligently sought for the man and found
him, and returned with him to the tent, and when he
had entreated him kindly, he sent him away on the
morrow with gifts.</p>

<p>14. And God spake again unto Abraham saying, For
this thy sin shall thy seed be afflicted four hundred
years in a strange land.</p>

<p class="fs60 pad2">SIR,</p>

<p>I understand from the public papers, that in
the debates on the bill for relieving the dissenters in
the point of subscription to the church articles, sundry
reflections were thrown out against the people, importing,
that they themselves are of a persecuting intolerant
spirit, for that when they had the superiority, they persecuted
the church, and still persecute it in America,
where they compel its members to pay taxes for maintaining
the presbyterian or independent worship, and
at the same time refuse them a toleration in the full
exercise of their religion, by the administrations of a
bishop.</p>

<p>If we look back into history for the character of the
present sects in Christianity, we shall find few that have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>not, in their turns, been persecutors and complainers
of persecution. The primitive christians thought persecution
extremely wrong in the pagans, but practised
it on one another. The first protestants of the church
of England blamed persecution in the Romish church,
but practised it against the puritans: these found it
wrong in the bishops, but fell into the same practice
both here and in New England.&mdash;To account for this,
we should remember, that the doctrine of <em>toleration</em> was
not then known, or had not prevailed in the world.
Persecution was therefore not so much the fault of the
sect as of the times. It was not in those days deemed
wrong <em>in itself</em>. The general opinion was only, that
those <em>who are in error</em> ought not to persecute <em>the truth</em>:
but the <em>possessors of truth</em> were in the right to persecute
error, in order to destroy it. Thus every sect believing
itself possessed of <em>all truth</em>, and that every tenet differing
from theirs was <em>error</em>, conceived, that when the
power was in their hands, persecution was a duty required
of them by that God whom they supposed to be
offended with heresy.&mdash;By degrees, more moderate <em>and
more modest</em> sentiments have taken place in the christian
world; and among protestants particularly, all disclaim
persecution, none vindicate it, and few practise it.&mdash;We
should then cease to reproach each other with what
was done by our ancestors, but judge of the present
character of sects or churches by their <em>present conduct</em>
only<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>
<p>Now to determine on the justice of this charge
against the present dissenters, particularly those in
America, let us consider the following facts. They
went from England to establish a new country for
themselves, <em>at their own expence</em>, where they might
enjoy the free exercise of religion in their own way.
When they had purchased the territory of the natives,
they granted the lands out in townships, requiring for
it neither purchase-money nor quit-rent, but this condition
only to be complied with, that the freeholders
should support a gospel-minister (meaning probably
one of the then governing sects) and a free-school,
within the township. Thus, what is commonly called
presbyterianism became the <em>established religion</em> of that
country. All went on well in this way, while the same
religious opinions were general, the support of minister
and school being raised by a proportionate tax on the
lands. But, in process of time, some becoming quakers<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>,
some baptists, and of late years, some returning
to the church of England (through the laudable endeavours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>and a <em>proper application</em><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> of their funds by the
society for propagating the gospel), objections were
made to the payment of a tax appropriated to the support
of a church they disapproved and had forsaken.
The civil magistrates, however, continued for a time to
collect and apply the tax according to the original laws,
which remained in force; and they did it the more
freely as thinking it just and equitable, that the holders
of lands should pay what was contracted to be paid
when they were granted, as the only consideration for
the grant, and what had been considered by all subsequent
purchasers as a perpetual incumbrance on the
estate, bought therefore at a proportionally cheaper
rate; a payment which, it was thought, no honest man
ought to avoid, under pretence of his having changed
his religious persuasion: and this, I suppose, is one of
the best grounds of demanding tythes of dissenters now
in England. But the practice being clamoured against
by the episcopalians as persecution, the legislature of
the province of Massachusets Bay, near thirty years
since, passed an act for their relief, requiring, indeed,
the tax to be paid as usual, but directing that the several
sums, levied from members of the church of England,
should be paid over to the minister of that church with
whom such members usually attended divine worship;
which minister had power given him to receive, and, on
occasion, <em>to recover the same by law</em>.</p>

<p>It seems that legislature considered, that the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
tax was to secure and improve the morals of the people,
and promote their happiness, by supporting among
them the public worship of God and the preaching of
the gospel; that where particular people fancied a
particular mode, that mode might probably, therefore,
be of most use to those people, and that if the good
was done, it was not so material in what mode or by
whom it was done. The consideration, that their brethren,
the dissenters in England, were still compelled
to pay tythes to the clergy of the church, had not
weight enough with the legislature to prevent this moderate
act, which still continues in full force; and I
hope no uncharitable conduct of the church toward
the dissenters will ever provoke them to repeal it.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>With regard to <em>a bishop</em>, I know not upon what
ground the dissenters, either here or in America, are
charged with refusing the benefit of such an officer to
the church in that country. <em>Here</em> they seem to have
naturally no concern in the affair. <em>There</em> they have
no power to prevent it, if government should think fit
to send one. They would probably <em>dislike</em>, indeed, to
see an order of men established among them, from
whose persecutions their fathers fled into that wilderness,
and whose future domination they might possibly
fear, <em>not knowing that their natures are changed</em>.&mdash;But
the non-appointment of bishops for America seems to
arise from another quarter. The same wisdom of government,
probably, that prevents the sitting of convocations,
and forbids, by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noli prosequi's</i>, the persecution
of dissenters for non-subscription, avoids establishing
bishops, where the minds of people are not yet prepared
to receive them cordially, lest the public peace
should be endangered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>And now let us see how this <em>persecution-account</em> stands
between the parties.</p>

<p>In New England, where the legislative bodies are
almost to a man dissenters from the church of England:</p>

<p>1. There is no test to prevent churchmen holding
offices.</p>

<p>2. The sons of churchmen have the full benefit of
the universities.</p>

<p>3. The taxes for support of public worship, when
paid by churchmen, are given to the episcopal minister.</p>

<p>In Old England:</p>

<p>1. Dissenters are excluded from all offices of profit
and honour.</p>

<p>2. The benefits of education in the universities are
appropriated to the sons of churchmen.</p>

<p>3. The clergy of the dissenters receive none of the
tythes paid by their people, who must be at the additional
charge of maintaining their own separate worship.&mdash;</p>

<p>But it is said, that the dissenters of America <em>oppose</em>
the introduction of a bishop.</p>

<p>In fact, it is not alone the dissenters there that give
the opposition (if <em>not encouraging</em> must be termed <em>opposing</em>)
but the laity in general dislike the project, and
some even of the clergy. The inhabitants of Virginia
are almost all episcopalians, the church is fully established
there, and the council and general assembly
are, perhaps to a man, its members: yet, when lately
at a meeting of the clergy, a resolution was taken to
apply for a bishop, against which several however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
protested; assembly of the province, at the next
meeting, expressed their disapprobation of the thing in
the strongest manner, by unanimously ordering the
thanks of the house to the protesters; for many of the
American laity of the church think it some advantage&mdash;whether
their own young men come to England for
ordination, and improve themselves at the same time by
conversation with the learned here&mdash;or the congregations
are supplied by Englishmen, who have had the
benefit of education in English universities, and are
ordained before they came abroad. They do not,
therefore, see the necessity of a bishop merely for ordination;
and confirmation is among them deemed a
ceremony of no very great importance, since few seek
it in England, where bishops are in plenty.&mdash;These
sentiments prevail with many churchmen there, not to
promote a design which they think must sooner or later
saddle them with great expences to support it.&mdash;As to
the dissenters, their minds might probably be more
conciliated to the measure, if the bishops here should, in
their wisdom and goodness, think fit to set their sacred
character in a more friendly light, by dropping their
opposition to the dissenters' application for relief in
subscription, and declaring their willingness that dissenters
should be capable of offices, enjoy the benefit
of education in the universities, and the privilege of
appropriating their tythes to the support of their own
clergy. In all these points of toleration, they appear
far behind the present dissenters of New England, and
it may seem to some a step below the dignity of
bishops, to follow the example of such inferiors. I do
not, however, despair of their doing it some time or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
other, since nothing of the kind is too hard for <em>true
christian humility</em>.</p>

<p>Reading in the newspapers the speech of Mr.
Jackson in congress, against meddling with the affair of
slavery, or attempting to mend the condition of slaves,
it put me in mind of a similar speech, made about one
hundred years since, by Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim, a member
of the divan of Algiers, which may be seen in Martin's
account of his consulship, 1687. It was against
granting the petition of the sect called erika, or purists,
who prayed for the abolition of piracy and slavery, as
being unjust.&mdash;Mr. Jackson does not quote it; perhaps
he has not seen it. If therefore, some of its reasonings
are to be found in his eloquent speech, it may only
show, that men's interests operate, and are operated on,
with surprising similarity, in all countries and climates,
whenever they are under similar circumstances. The
African speech, as translated, is as follows:</p>

<p>"Alla Bismillah, &amp;c. God is great, and Mahomet is
his prophet.</p>

<p>"Have these erika considered the consequences of
granting their petition? If we cease our cruises against
the christians, how shall we be furnished with the commodities
their countries produce, and which are so necessary
for us? If we forbear to make slaves of their
people, who, in this hot climate, are to cultivate our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>lands? Who are to perform the common labours of our
city, and of our families? Must we not then be our
own slaves? And is there not more compassion and
more favour due to us mussulmen, than to those
christian dogs?&mdash;We have now above fifty thousand
slaves in and near Algiers. This number, if not kept
up by fresh supplies, will soon diminish, and be gradually
annihilated. If, then, we cease taking and plundering
the infidel ships, and making slaves of the seamen
and passengers, our lands will become of no value,
for want of cultivation; the rents of houses in the city
will sink one half; and the revenues of government,
arising from the share of prizes, must be totally destroyed.&mdash;And
for what? To gratify the whim of a
whimsical sect, who would have us not only forbear
making more slaves, but even manumit those we have.
But who is to indemnify their masters for the loss?
Will the state do it? Is our treasury sufficient? Will
the erika do it? Can they do it? Or would they, to do
what they think justice to the slaves, do a greater injustice
to the owners? And if we set our slaves free, what
is to be done with them? Few of them will return to
their native countries; they know too well the greater
hardships they must there be subject to. They will not
embrace our holy religion: they will not adopt our manners:
our people will not pollute themselves by intermarrying
with them. Must we maintain them as
beggars in our streets; or suffer our properties to be
the prey of their pillage? for men, accustomed to slavery,
will not work for a livelihood, when not compelled.&mdash;And
what is there so pitiable in their present condition?
Were they not slaves in their own countries?
Are not Spain, Portugal, France, and the Italian states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
governed by despots, who hold all their subjects in slavery,
without exception? Even England treats her sailors
as slaves, for they are, whenever the government
pleases, seized and confined in ships of war, condemned
not only to work, but to fight for small wages, or a mere
subsistence, not better than our slaves are allowed by us.
Is their condition then made worse by their falling into
our hands? no; they have only exchanged one slavery
for another; and I may say a better: for here they are
brought into a land, where the sun of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'islanism'">islamism</ins> gives
forth its light, and shines in full splendor, and they
have an opportunity of making themselves acquainted
with the true doctrine, and thereby saving their immortal
souls. Those who remain at home have not that
happiness. Sending the slaves home then, would be
sending them out of light into darkness.</p>

<p>"I repeat the question, what is to be done with them?
I have heard it suggested, that they may be planted in
the wilderness, where there is plenty of land for them
to subsist on, and where they may flourish as a free
state.&mdash;But they are, I doubt, too little disposed to
labour without compulsion, as well as too ignorant to
establish good government: and the wild Arabs would
soon molest and destroy, or again enslave them. While
serving us, we take care to provide them with every
thing; and they are treated with humanity. The labourers
in their own countries are, as I am informed,
worse fed, lodged, and clothed. The condition of most
of them is therefore already mended, and requires no
farther improvement. Here their lives are in safety.
They are not liable to be impressed for soldiers, and
forced to cut one another's christian throats, as in the
wars of their own countries. If some of the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
mad bigots, who now tease us with their silly petitions,
have, in a fit of blind zeal, freed their slaves, it was not
generosity, it was not humanity, that moved them to the
action; it was from the conscious burthen of a load of
sins, and hope, from the supposed merits of so good a
work, to be excused from damnation.&mdash;How grossly
are they mistaken, in imagining slavery to be disavowed
by the Alcoran! Are not the two precepts, to quote no
more, "Masters, treat your slaves with kindness&mdash;Slaves,
serve your masters with cheerfulness and fidelity,"
clear proofs to the contrary? Nor can the plundering
of infidels be in that sacred book forbidden;
since it is well known from it, that God has given the
world, and all that it contains, to his faithful mussulmen,
who are to enjoy it, of right, as fast as they can
conquer it. Let us then hear no more of this detestable
proposition, the manumission of christian slaves,
the adoption of which would, by depreciating our lands
and houses, and thereby depriving so many good citizens
of their properties, create universal discontent, and
provoke insurrections, to the endangering of government
and producing general confusion. I have, therefore,
no doubt that this wise council will prefer the
comfort and happiness of a whole nation of true believers,
to the whim of a few erika, and dismiss their petition."</p>

<p>The result was, as Martin tells us, that the divan
came to this resolution: "That the doctrine, that the
plundering and enslaving the christians is unjust, is at
best problematical; but that it is the interest of this
state to continue the practice is clear; therefore, let the
petition be rejected."&mdash;&mdash;And it was rejected accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>And since like motives are apt to produce, in the
minds of men, like opinions and resolutions, may we
not venture to predict, from this account, that the petitions
to the parliament of England for abolishing the
slave-trade, to say nothing of other legislatures and the
debates upon them, will have a similar conclusion.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Power of this Court.</em></p>

<p>It may receive and promulgate accusations of all
kinds, against all persons and characters among the citizens
of the state, and even against all inferior courts;
and may judge, sentence, and condemn to infamy, not
only private individuals, but public bodies, &amp;c. with or
without enquiry or hearing, at the court's discretion.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Whose Favour, or for whose Emolument this Court is
established.</em></p>

<p>In favour of about one citizen in five hundred, who,
by education, or practice in scribbling, has acquired a
tolerable style as to grammar and construction, so as to
bear printing; or who is possessed of a press and a few
types. This five hundredth part of the citizens have
the privilege of accusing and abusing the other four
hundred and ninety-nine parts, at their pleasure; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
they may hire out their pens and press to others, for
that purpose.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Practice of this Court.</em></p>

<p>It is not governed by any of the rules of the common
courts of law. The accused is allowed no grand
jury to judge of the truth of the accusation before it is
publicly made; nor is the name of the accuser made
known to him; nor has he an opportunity of confronting
the witnesses against him, for they are kept in the
dark, as in the Spanish court of inquisition. Nor is
there any petty jury of his peers sworn to try the truth
of the charges. The proceedings are also sometimes so
rapid, that an honest good citizen may find himself suddenly
and unexpectedly accused, and in the same morning
judged and condemned, and sentence pronounced
against him, that he is a rogue and a villain. Yet if an
officer of this court receives the slightest check for
misconduct in this his office, he claims immediately the
rights of a free citizen by the constitution, and demands
to know his accuser, to confront the witnesses, and to
have a fair trial by a jury of his peers.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Foundation of its Authority.</em></p>

<p>It is said to be founded on an article in the state constitution,
which establishes the liberty of the press&mdash;a
liberty which every Pennsylvanian would fight and die
for, though few of us, I believe, have distinct ideas of
its nature and extent. It seems, indeed, somewhat like
the liberty of the press, that felons have, by the common
law of England, before conviction; that is, to be
either pressed to death or hanged. If, by the liberty
of the press, were understood merely the liberty of dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>cussing
the propriety of public measures and political
opinions, let us have as much of it as you please; but
if it means the liberty of affronting, calumniating, and
defaming one another, I, for my part, own myself willing
to part with my share of it, whenever our legislators
shall please so to alter the law; and shall cheerfully
consent to exchange my liberty of abusing others, for
the privilege of not being abused myself.</p>

<p class="center"><em>By whom this Court is commissioned or constituted.</em></p>

<p>It is not by any commission from the supreme executive
council, who might previously judge of the abilities,
integrity, knowledge, &amp;c. of the persons to be appointed
to this great trust, of deciding upon the characters
and good fame of the citizens: for this court is
above that council, and may accuse, judge, and condemn
it at pleasure. Nor is it hereditary, as is the
court of dernier resort in the peerage of England. But any
man who can procure pen, ink, and paper, with a press,
a few types, and a huge pair of blacking balls, may
commissionate himself, and his court is immediately
established in the plenary possession and exercise of its
rights. For if you make the least complaint of the
judge's conduct, he daubs his blacking balls in your
face wherever he meets you; and, besides tearing your
private character to splinters, marks you out for the
odium of the public, as an enemy to the liberty of the
press.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Of the natural Support of this Court.</em></p>

<p>Its support is founded in the depravity of such minds,
as have not been mended by religion, nor improved by
good education.</p>

<p>Whoever feels pain in hearing a good character of
his neighbour, will feel a pleasure in the reverse. And
of those who, despairing to rise to distinction by their
virtues, are happy if others can be depressed to a level
with themselves, there are a number sufficient in every
great town to maintain one of these courts by their subscription.
A shrewd observer once said, that in walking
the streets of a slippery morning, one might see
where the good-natured people lived, by the ashes
thrown on the ice before the doors: probably he would
have formed a different conjecture of the temper of
those whom he might find engaged in such subscriptions.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Of the Checks proper to be established against the Abuses
of Power in those Courts.</em></p>

<p>Hitherto there are none. But since so much has
been written and published on the federal constitution;
and the necessity of checks, in all other parts of good
government, has been so clearly and learnedly explained,
I find myself so far enlightened as to suspect
some check may be proper in this part also: but I have
been at a loss to imagine any, that may not be construed
an infringement of the sacred liberty of the press. At
length, however, I think I have found one, that, instead
of diminishing general liberty, shall augment it; which
is, by restoring to the people a species of liberty of
which they have been deprived by our laws, I mean the
liberty of the cudgel! In the rude state of society, prior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
to the existence of laws, if one man gave another ill-language,
the affronted person might return it by a box
on the ear; and if repeated, by a good drubbing; and
this without offending against any law: but now the
right of making such returns is denied, and they are
punished as breaches of the peace, while the right of
abusing seems to remain in full force; the laws made
against it being rendered ineffectual by the liberty of
the press.</p>

<p>My proposal then is, to leave the liberty of the press
untouched, to be exercised in its full extent, force, and
vigour, but to permit the liberty of the cudgel to go
with it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i>. Thus, my fellow citizens, if an impudent
writer attacks your reputation&mdash;dearer perhaps
to you than your life, and puts his name to the charge,
you may go to him as openly, and break his head. If
he conceals himself behind the printer, and you can
nevertheless discover who he is, you may, in like manner,
way-lay him in the night, attack him behind, and
give him a good drubbing. If your adversary hires
better writers than himself to abuse you more effectually,
you may hire brawny porters, stronger than yourself,
to assist you in giving him a more effectual drubbing.
Thus far goes my project, as to <em>private</em> resentment
and retribution. But if the public should ever
happen to be affronted, as it ought to be, with the conduct
of such writers, I would not advise proceeding immediately
to these extremities, but that we should in
moderation content ourselves with tarring and feathering,
and tossing them in a blanket.</p>

<p>If, however, it should be thought, that this proposal
of mine may disturb the public peace, I would then
humbly recommend to our legislators to take up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
consideration of both liberties, that of the press, and
that of the cudgel; and by an explicit law mark their
extent and limits: and at the same time that they secure
the person of a citizen from assaults, they would likewise
provide for the security of his reputation.</p>

<strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong><br />
<br />

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Several pages of the book contain a <a href="#REF_ALPH">description and examples</a> of a
modified alphabet proposed by B.F. There are six new characters in his alphabet;
these, and the example text using them (pages 360-366 in the original book) are shown as
images in this ebook.</p>

<p>For consistency and clarity, the pound abbreviation 'l.' has been italicized,
so for example '123,321l.' has been replaced by '123,321<i>l.</i>' in the etext.</p>

<p>For consistency, the date and salutation at the beginning of each
letter, and the closing and name at the end of each letter,
have been put on separate lines (they were sometimes placed on the
same line in the original printed text).</p>

<p>A '<a href="#PLATES">List of the Plates</a>' has been created and added in front of the Errata.</p>

<p>Asterisks were used by the editor to indicate omitted text.
For consistency, '****' is used when at the beginning or end
of a letter, otherwise a line of 5 spaced asterisks is used.</p>

<p>A deliberate blank space in the text, eg <a href="#Page_70">pg 70</a>, is indicated by [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</p>

<p>All the changes noted in the Errata (<a href="#ERRATA">pg vi</a>) have been applied to the text.</p>

<p>Many Footnotes have the signature 'B. V.' rather than 'Editor'. This is
explained in Vol 1 p 399 Footnote [90], and is copied below for the
reader's convenience:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">Wherever this signature occurs, the note is taken from a volume of
Dr. Franklin's writings, entitled Political, Miscellaneous, and
Philosophical Pieces, printed for Johnson, 1779. The editor of that
volume, though a young man at the time, had already evinced
extraordinary talents, and was the friend and correspondent of our
author. As he has chosen to withhold his name, we conceive ourselves
not entitled to disclose it: but we shall take the freedom of an
acquaintance to use the notes occasionally, deeming them in many
instances valuable historical records. Editor.</div>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, misspelling in the text, and
inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.
For example, compleat; cieling; inclose; watry; smoak; spunge;
Pensylvania; Massachussets; newspaper, news-paper; midnight, mid-night.</p>

<p>The <a href="#INDEX">Index</a> covers all three volumes and was originally printed
at the end of Volume 1 only. It has been copied to the end of
Volume 2 and 3 as a convenience for the reader.</p>

<p>The Index had no page numbers in the original text; page numbers from
1i to 36i have been added for completeness. For clarity, some volume
identifiers (i. or ii. or iii.) have been added, or removed, in the
index. Only references within this volume have been hyperlinked.</p>

<p>The Index has some references to page numbers with a *, eg 551*.  These
are valid references; the book printer inserted pages 543*-556* between
pages 542 and 543 in Vol iii.
